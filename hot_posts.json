        "selftext": "HP Inc. (HPQ) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results today, after-hours. The webcast will be available at www.hp.com/investor/2023Q2Webcast\n\nAnalysts forecast earnings of $0.760 per share compared to earnings of $1.08 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting sales of $13.07 billion, an decrease of 20.72% over the prior year quarter. For the current fiscal year, they expect earnings per share of $3.31 compared to $4.08 per share in the previous year. On average, the expected revenue is $55.09 billion, compared to $62.98 billion last year.\n\nHPQ\u2019s second-quarter performance is likely to have witnessed a negative impact of the slowdown in consumer demand for PCs and high inventory levels. HP witnessed the robust demand for its PCs during the pandemic-led work-and-learn-from-home wave. However, the reopening of economies and offices, inflationary pressure and recession concerns have been waning the demand for PCs.\n\nFurthermore, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This might have hurt HPQ\u2019s commercial PC sales in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the preliminary data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC) in April 2023, PC shipments in the January-March 2023 quarter plunged [29% year over year](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/10/idc-worldwide-pc-shipments-fell-29-first-quarter/) to 56.9 million units. The latest data compiled by the market research firm depicts the fifth consecutive quarter of a PC sales decline following two successive years of strong year-over-year growth, driven by the pandemic-led increased demand for remote working and online-learning tools.\n\nAccording to IDC, the year-over-year fall was mostly brought on by a decline in consumer demand for PCs, excessive inventory levels, and a dismal prognosis for the economy. PC demand fell as a result of persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty and softening IT spending.\n\nHPQ\u2019s Printing division\u2019s sales are likely to have been hampered by softened consumer demand. The consensus mark for the segment\u2019s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.58 billion, indicating a year-over-year drop of 7.8%.\n\nAdditionally, HPQ's second-quarter bottom line probably reaped the rewards of competitive pricing, strict cost control, and a superior product mix. The advantages are likely to be more than offset by decreased revenues, higher commodity prices, unfavourable currency exchange rates, additional expenditures in innovation, and the go-to-market strategy.\n\nThis sounds pretty bearish. What's interesting is that HP did beat EPS last quarter and still dropped. I think getting puts would be a pretty easy choice, considering everything above. I'll be grabbing the HPQ 6/2 30p for 41 bucks each. Unless you think they'll say \"AI\" a bunch of times, it would be unreasonable to grab calls.",

        "selftext": "Not financial advice!\n\nNvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard\u2019s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.\n\nSo\u2026 Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.\n\nIt's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.\n\nBut here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.\n\nAnd how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.\n\nNow, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.\n\nBottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting \"hybrid cloud or bust!\" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.\n\nIBM\u2019s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two\u2019s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO",

(seriously fuck that guy!)\n\nWhat is Uipath and what do they do?\n\nUiPath, my fellow degenerates, is the absolute king of Robotic Process Automation (RPA)! Their software platform allows companies to automate mundane, repetitive tasks that used to suck the life out of their employees. Think about all those poor office workers buried under piles of paperwork, drowning in manual data entry. Well, UiPath swoops in like a superhero, streamlining processes and freeing up time for the good stuff.\n\nBut why is this important, you may ask, ? Well, because companies are obsessed with efficiency, baby! By automating processes with UiPath's cutting-edge technology, businesses can dramatically increase productivity and reduce costs. And you know what that means? Big, fat, juicy profits! More productivity equals more money, and more money means a skyrocketing stock price!\n\nLet's talk numbers, fam. UiPath's revenue growth has been nothing short of mind-blowing. They've been consistently doubling their revenue year over year, and since they are a software only company their margins are insane! currently they have 3x assets sitting on their balance sheets compared to their liabilities, and if that doesn't make your dick tingle, I don't know what will! With a market that's estimated to be worth in the hundreds billions, UiPath has plenty of room to grow and become the undisputed champ of the automation game.\n\nLastly, let's not forget the \"Moat Factor\" here. UiPath isn't just some one-trick pony. They've built a robust ecosystem of partners , developers, and integrations, making it a pain in the butt for competitors to catch up. It's like they've surrounded themselves with a fortress of innovation, leaving others in the dust. And you know what happens when a company has a moat? Couple all of that with the growing fever around everything AI and this ticker is a ticking time. you can thank me later after you score a 100x\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: UiPath is the ultimate RPA champion, automating processes and boosting company productivity. With rapid revenue growth, Solid balance sheet, a expanding customer base, a solid moat, and the current AI fever UiPath has the potential to make us all tendie millionaires as we ride this rocket to the moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcb0",

Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.\n\n1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.\n2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.\n3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.\n4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",

So far in 2023, food has been the most effective indicator for predicting inflation, with healthcare also growing in significance.\n\n**Are we nearing the 2% goal?**\n\nThere are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.

Investing in the stock market involves a significant risk of loss, including the risk of loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.**\n\n**Disclosure: At the time of this publication, I, the author, personally hold a position in $NVDA. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.\n\nWhile the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.\n\n**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**\n\nBefore we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.\n\nLet's get into it!\n\nNvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.\n\nTo begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.\n\nIn the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.\n\nPreviously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.\n\nNVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.\n\nFibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.\n\nLet's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:\n\n1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67\n2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \\* 1.618 = 464.02\n3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15\n\nHowever, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.\n\nIn summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.\n\nDuring the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, where do we stand?**\n\nNvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bear Scenario:**\n\nWhile we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.\n\nOne notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.\n\nThese are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bull Scenario:**\n\nOn the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.\n\nFor perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.\n\nAs NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it\u2019s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Realistic Scenario:**\n\nBased on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.\n\nWhile it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!",

        "selftext": "Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.\n\nHere's what he said:\n\nLESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help\n\nNvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. \n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n\"After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...\n\nI contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. \n\nI was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.\n\nConfronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.\"\n\nLESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream\n\nIn 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. \n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n\"Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...\n\nWe suffered many years of poor performance. \n\nOur shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...\n\nThis journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.\"\n\nLESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work\n\nIn 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.\n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n\"The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...\n\nNvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. \n\nWe should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...\n\nOur strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.\n\nTo retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. \n\nRetreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.\"\n\n//\n\nJensen wrapped up the speech with this:\n\n\"Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:\n\n1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.\n2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.\n3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.\"\n\n\n\n\nDamn, this give speech gives me Steve Jobs vibes. I am even more impressed with Nvidia\u2019s leadership now as a shareholder.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello Autists, \n\nToday I am presenting Redfin (RDFN) and why it can and will be a 200% play over the next two years. Yes, I did say 200%. Just on stock, not even counting options. Let's jump in. \n\n**Investment Thesis:** Redfin a super cyclical stock will be rebounding with great strength due to Online Real Estate Market Growth, AI investments, diverse Revenue Streams, and most importantly shrinking interest rate environment to kick it all off. They also got rid of their Buying program and implemented for the first time now the Redfin Premier Nationwide service to homebuyers. \n\n***What is Redfin?***\n\nRedfin is a residential online real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one\u2019s real estate needs. \n\nThey also use the same combination of technology and local service to originate mortgage loans and offer title and settlement services. They also offer digital platforms to connect consumers with available apartments and houses for rent.\n\n**Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**\n\nReal Estate agents have to be the biggest thieves taking 6% commission being a realtor. Every $1,000,000 home sold equals $60,000 in fees for a license that can be earned in 75 classroom hours. And requires no technical skills or degree. Nothing against real estate agents, but after watching Selling Sunset on Netflix and working in real estate investments myself, I am ready to see the real estate market adapt, and move past agents who don\u2019t provide more than $20 of value and headaches saying \u201cLocation, location, location\u201d so I can buy more FD and OTD\u2019s in my brokerage**.** \n\n**Investment Thesis Catalysts:** \n\n**Online Real Estate Market Growth and Market Share:** There is ongoing shift towards online platforms in the real estate industry that present an opportunity for Redfin to capture a larger share of the market. As more homebuyers and sellers embrace digital solutions, Redfin's technology-driven approach and user-friendly platform could lead to increased adoption and market penetration.\n\nIf any of you autists have ever used RDFN then you know first hand that there is a smooth process with limited conflict of interest since their agents are not commission based. People are becoming tired of the fees posed by traditional agents. Even though there has been a slow down in revenues across the real estate brokerage industry, going forward in a digital world I expect this to continue to grow. \n\nRedfin currently only has .78% of the entire market share in the US\u2026.there is room for growth for this billion dollar market cap company where they are actually not being thieves for 6%. \n\nThe company's growth initiatives, such as geographic expansion and strategic partnerships, will contribute to its market dominance and attract more customers. **They just initiated Redfin Premier Nationwide.**\n\nRedfin Premier is a specialized service that caters to high-end and luxury properties. It is designed to provide enhanced marketing and representation for luxury homes in select markets.Redfin Premier offers a range of features and services to sellers and buyers of luxury properties. These may include professional photography and video tours, custom marketing materials, targeted online advertising, and exposure on high-traffic websites and publications. And you know what they say\u2026luxury products bring luxury margins. \n\n**Redfin also launched in 2022 their acquisition from 2021 RentPath**, because lets be honest owning a home for many people right now is a pipedream and now has a rental search. This creates a new pipeline of consumers in different phases of life and I don\u2019t know how many of y\u2019all have been apartment shopping recently but damn these rents just keep going up. While Redfin is known for home buying and selling services\u2026 apartment rentals is a new slice of the pie to grow into. And most of the time M&A is a waste of time but this I think added value to Redfin. \n\n**AI Investments:** I knew by putting AI in this, some of yall would make your keyboard sticky. They are making continued investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis to make sure they provide personalized recommendations, improve user experience, and streamline the home buying and selling process to take consumer money and make us tendies. \n\n**Industry Trends:**\n\nReal Estate transactions have gotten wrecked. Interest rates affect this industry a fuck ton. Redfin\u2019s share price has plummeted since 2022. Interest rates and recessionary environments have made homebuyers less of a rush to close deals. \n\nMany experts in the mortgage industry see rates going down especially with the government preventing a US debt default. As the banking sector calms down. Economic data points towards a strong economy, and inflation eases, rates hopefully will go downward through the end of 2023. Fed tightening may put some upward pressure on mortgage rates in the near term, but ultimately more certainty about the Fed\u2019s actions will help to smooth out some of the volatility we have seen with mortgage rates. It is likely that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in May, which may represent the peak for the current round of policy tightening. Also if inflation surprises to the downside or recession fears intensify, mortgage rates could fall.\n\n**Risks/The Dirty: Why this Stock has fallen 90% from its peak.** \n\nReal Estate market got fucked worse than an episode of Brazzers. Interest rates got hiked worse than Johnny Sins morning wood and a recession made people less likely to move. This combination wrecked REITs, brokerages, growth stocks, every autists portfolios, even those losers in r/dividends with their measly .69 cents quarterly payments. \n\nRisks include \n\n* Interest Rates\n* Financial Health (They need to crank out some earnings, they are using preferred stock, stock based comp, and senior notes to get through rough times)\n* Housing Market (Back to interest rates, houses need to be being bought.)\n\nThe good news is, I see that the stock has been wrecked by the risks above. And as the light at the end of tunnel gets closer the stock should derisk itself assuming real estate armageddon does not hit and the stock price should go up. I do not think it will get anywhere near the former all time high stock price in the next couple years, but think it will bring great gains that outpace the general market. \n\n**Future Outlook from Q1 2023 Earnings:**\n\n* Reduced staff and made organizational changes, making support staff ratios to agents better\n* Focused on mortgage cross selling business, concierge services, expanding Redfin Preimer Nationwide\n* Exited the home buying business that again, fucked earnings like a scene out of brazzers. \n* Aim to return to the traditional broker model, increasing monetization.\n* Projected real Estate Service back to growth in Q2 2023 and strong double digit growth in rental and mortgage businesses. \n* They expected adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven or better for 2023, $190 million better than 2022.\n\n**Valuation Notes:**\n\nThe stock has been hammered\u2026look at the stock chart. A lot of worst case nightmare scenarios came true for RDFN. Now RDFN is not a real estate company or REIT, it is a brokerage but also a tech stock. One of the biggest surprises when analyzing RDFN is their price to sales ratio. \n\nRDFN has a P/S ratio of .51 which is incredibly low and before covid traded anywhere from 1.25 to 1.8 regularly. Because the company is not currently profitable it is a great ratio to do a quick comp. Meanwhile stocks like PLTR have a 14.6x P/S ratio. I know they aren\u2019t the same company or growth or macro factors. But as this stock continues to have a great 2023 and market cap grows, more and more institutional investors will enter this heavily cyclical stock that has the most to gain in a great economic cycle. \n\nAs revenues rebound and grow, hopefully becoming profitable, see no reason this stock cannot hit over $30 in 30 months. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nGood stock. Fucked from tough times past 2 years. Innovative product that actually provides value at much more of a discount then some 6% sucking vampire real estate agent. Buy for tendies. I like it as interest rates go down, house buying environment picks back up, continued expansion, and better margins. Hopefully the worst is behind us and as earnings grow and the stock derisks, stock price will spike. \n\n**Positions:**\n\n1600 Shares at $10.16, looking to add more. And looking to add leaps for 2024/2025.",

        "selftext": "The relationship between various financial indicators, such as the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index), stock market, and treasury bonds, can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including the signing of the debt ceiling...\n\n1. Strengthening of DXY and the Dollar: The U.S. Dollar is considered a safe-haven currency, meaning that during times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often seek to hold their assets in USD. When the debt ceiling is signed, it signifies that the U.S. government has taken steps to address its debt obligations, which can restore confidence in the economy and the stability of the U.S. Dollar. As a result, demand for the Dollar may increase, leading to its appreciation relative to other currencies, as reflected in the DXY.\n\n2. Decline in Stocks: The signing of the debt ceiling can sometimes create concerns about the potential impact on government spending and the overall economy. If investors perceive that the government's ability to meet its financial obligations is in question, it can lead to increased uncertainty and risk aversion in the stock market. Investors may sell off stocks and move their investments to safer assets, such as treasury bonds, causing stock prices to decline.\n\n3. Rise in Treasury Bonds: Treasury bonds are considered relatively safe investments backed by the U.S. government. During periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often shift their funds from riskier assets, like stocks, to the perceived safety of treasury bonds. This increased demand for bonds can drive up their prices and lower their yields. Consequently, when the debt ceiling is signed, and there is a restoration of confidence in the government's financial stability, investors may flock to treasury bonds, leading to their appreciation.",

        "selftext": "# A High Stakes Game: A.I., U.S. Debt Ceiling, and the New Market Norm\n\n**May 27th Recap**\n\nThe stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.\n\nThis positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.\n\nAs a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.\n\n[**SPY hits 420.72 (0%) (T.P. 1) on the Daily Chart**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13mryz0/spy_technical_analysis_for_monday_may_22_2022/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ukln516rk2b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15c70e681269e721d5804d7b6b143f15a1fde3a4\n\n# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day\n\nAs the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.\n\nThe day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.\n\nAt 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.\n\nLastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.\n\n# COT Data - E-MINI S&P 500\n\nOverall, trading activity increases across all groups, with a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment changes. The increase in short positions among Dealer Intermediaries and Leveraged Funds suggests a growing bearish sentiment among these groups. Meanwhile, Asset Manager/Institutional and Other Reportables showed a shift towards a more bullish sentiment, increasing their long positions and decreasing their short positions.\n\nThe new COT report for E-MINI S&P 500 as of May 23, 2023, shows the following positions:\n\n* Dealer Intermediary: Long 491,690 (+48,280), Short 437,143 (+75,927), Spread 59,895 (-6,019)\n* Asset Manager/Institutional: Long 1,050,328 (+6,169), Short 422,716 (-8,405), Spread 220,961 (-10,174)\n* Leveraged Funds: Long 164,886 (+37,252), Short 682,787 (+53,877), Spread 53,056 (-4,147)\n* Other Reportables: Long 89,199 (+2,873), Short 235,642 (-17,703), Spread 7,195 (+285)\n* Nonreportable Positions: Long 248,726 (+5,119), Short 266,541 (-4,003)\n\n*The plus/minus numbers indicate the position change compared to the previous report. The numbers after the plus/minus represent each category's open interest percentage.*\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nTLDR (u/[**farmtechy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmtechy/)**)** \n\nThis analysis, viewed through the lens of both 4-hour and 1-hour charts, maintains a bullish bias. The 4-hour chart anticipates a swing low aligned with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG) alongside a significant equilibrium at 415.39. On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.\n\n**H4 Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8q2znkirk2b1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4bf8fd84f3f079fc79b6c258f5512bd0fb81780\n\nBias: In the context of the 4-hour chart, the present market analysis leans towards a bullish inclination, predicting a swing low on the H4 chart that aligns with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG). Additionally, a notable balance point is observed at the level of 415.39.\n\n**Critical Levels to Monitor**\n\nPrior Day High: 420.77\n\nPrior Day Low: 415.25\n\nFair Value Gaps: *(Fair Value Gaps refer to situations where market inefficiencies or imbalances exist.

The focus is primarily on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) spanning from 415.90 to 416.88 and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB) from 414.75 to 413.85. These zones fall within the current dealer range's discount zone, notably below the halfway mark of 417.38.\n\n**Critical Levels to Monitor**\n\nCurrent Dealer Range *(note that this range is only viable if we maintain the current high and break the character change at 419.05.)*\n\n0%: 420.89\n\n50%: 417.38\n\n100%: 413.87\n\nChange of Character: 419.05 *(Candle close below this level and look for FVGs and order block as downside targets)*\n\nFair Value Gaps: *(Fair Value Gaps refer to situations where market inefficiencies or imbalances exist.

Normally, the yield curve should slope upwards, giving us a glimmer of hope that things will get better in the future. But oh no, not this time. When the yield curve decides to go all emo on us and flip itself upside down, it's a clear indication that trouble is brewing. It's like the universe is saying, \"Hey, you thought life was going well? Think again, losers!\"\n\nHistorical Precedence: You know what they say, history loves repeating itself. And guess what? The inverted yield curve has become quite the trendsetter in predicting recessions. It's like this emo prophet, always warning us of the impending financial darkness. It predicted the 2008 global financial crisis, the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, and the recession of 1990-1991. So, buckle up, my fellow melancholic souls, because the yield curve is at it again, waving its recession flag high and mighty.\n\nRationale behind the Yield Curve's Predictive Power: Oh, the reasons behind this madness? They're just as gloomy and brooding as you'd expect. Prepare yourself for a journey through the darkest recesses of financial despair.\n\n1. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior: Ah, the melodrama of it all. An inverted yield curve reflects the collective fear and anxiety of investors. They're like a bunch of moody artists, analyzing every economic indicator, overthinking it all, and adjusting their portfolios accordingly. It's like they're saying, \"Life sucks, so let's invest in long-term bonds and drown in our sorrows together.\" Their actions shape the yield curve, giving us a glimpse into their pessimistic souls.\n2. Anticipation of Monetary Policy: Oh, those central banks, always messing things up. When the economy is doing well, they just can't help themselves but tighten the monetary policy. It's like they're taking a sledgehammer to a delicate flower, completely oblivious to the damage they're causing. And guess what? An inverted yield curve might just be their way of saying, \"We're tightening things up so much that you can kiss economic growth goodbye.\" Thanks a lot, central banks, you've truly outdone yourselves this time.\n3. Liquidity and Credit Conditions: Who needs money anyway? With an inverted yield curve, borrowing becomes a nightmare. Short-term borrowing costs shoot up, making it nearly impossible for businesses and individuals to access credit. It's like the universe is conspiring against us, pushing us into a corner and laughing at our futile attempts to stimulate the economy. Good luck trying to invest and spend when no one wants to lend you a single penny.\n4. Market Expectations of Future Growth: Oh joy, let's talk about expectations. An inverted yield curve is the epitome of pessimism. It's like the market is saying, \"We're screwed, so you might as well join us in this downward spiral.\" Investors and businesses start believing that the future is bleak, and surprise, surprise, their actions align with their despair. They reduce spending, cut back on investments, and inadvertently push the economy into a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom.\n\nConclusion: Well, folks, here we are again, on the brink of yet another recession, all thanks to our dear friend, the inverted yield curve. It's like life has a sick sense of humor, continuously reminding us that we can't escape the darkness that engulfs our financial world. So, go ahead, embrace your inner emo kid, because the yield curve has spoken, and it's predicting yet another round of economic misery. Prepare for the tears, the gloom, and the impending doom.",

The market decided it wanted to pullback and test 410 support first, however, with our first closure over 420 since August 19th I believe this bull run is just getting started. \n\nLooking back I was one day too early on Wednesday with my swing calls\u2026 shoulda done 3-7dte like I had considered before. \n\n**EVENTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dvogrhn392b1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c2f10ffd1db0942b10439420ed62bc5d7f29505\n\nFirst of if you didn\u2019t know\u2026 the markets are all closed Monday! \n\nWe have 4 fed speakers spread out through the week next week. And we also have a ton of heavy hitting data Wednesday through Friday. The most important one that I am waiting is JOLTS Wednesday, non farm Thursday and unemployment rate Friday. \n\n**MAKE IT MAKE SENSE** \n\nIf you remember post the last two FOMCs JPOW basically said we are not going to stop rate hiking and that will we will not see any rate cuts in 2023\u2026 What did markets do? Markets priced in a bunch of rate cuts by EOY (100bps cuts at one point but for the most part it was 75bps) and that sent the markets absolutely rallying\u2026\n\nNow look at this\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blu244xn392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4eda7bc2acf405afe29d01980e5c803c2fa99d1e\n\nIn the last week the markets have went from a 17.4% odds of a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting to now a 71.1% chance of a rate hike\u2026 yet what happened this week? We rallied..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22wl8rbo392b1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=336efbba37e305e6f296b3d94047e9fd35ac1e67\n\nNow not only that\u2026 but the markets went from just one week ago today pricing in a 44.7% odds of 75bps rate CUTS by end of year to now pricing in 39.4% odds (the highest odds) that we do not see any rate cuts by end of year\u2026\n\nNow I know markets can be a bit wacky\u2026 but how does it make sense that the markets went from expecting a fed pause and 75bps of rate CUTS by end of year to now expecting 25bps of rate HIKES next meeting and NO CUTS in one week and that week closes green on SPY?\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxuvczro392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=854edb5bba0c1c3aac8326427c162971a58ca97e\n\nOn the Daily we officially established a new demand (support) at 414.55. As I suspected if we pushed higher we would indeed make a new demand. The daily DMI is now waving higher and we have a new demand with bullish weekly support\u2026 the upside is what I would be looking for here and there is no real sense in shorting SPY right now. \n\nWe also closed over 418.78 and 419.5 supply\u2026 this means until we put a new supply in and we would need two red days back to back to do that our target remains the 429.68 area I pointed out last Friday. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvap7d7p392b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0755f3d06a07c476cdc564f7a662d224b5fe77cf\n\nOn a weekly time frame here the bears actually put up a REALLY big fight and until today the weekly was going to make a new supply and at one point we attempted to set up a closure below the weekly 411.46 demand. Nonetheless though bulls pushed us and we now sit over the 416.09 weekly supply after retesting support of the 411.46 demand. The weekly DMI continues to wave up and we also continue to push higher with no new weekly supply\u2026\n\nOur target remains 427.35 and in the chance we blow through that roof I have no major supply level until 453.23. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tdzi1pp392b1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55ca6ba5ee0e71703ba1d90fe82a793d625bbb4d\n\nAs you can see from the daily here we once action have made a new lower rising wedge support (this has been a theme for a while now). We also had a very nice v bottom off of 410.53 and we have for the first time since August closed over 419.5 resistance. Its not pictured here but this orange channel has a upper resistance of 427.5. As of right now that is the bulls target. \n\nWe will keep a close eye on that red rising wedge though as this resistance could still with 3 touches hold as resistance into next week. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kltuvx4q392b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=585d42060e3f93ff6618500700b3b392f5fdaaed\n\nAs you can see we are in a bigger blue rising wedge that days back to September and we are also in more of a short term black/ blue rising wedge.\n\nThis blue rising wedge resistance is all the way up at 434.27 for next week and shows a clear path to 430-440 by end of June. The black rising wedge resistance sits at 425.4 for next week. The way this weekly candle with the very long wick bounce off the weekly 8ema is makes me believe in continuation to the upside for next week. \n\nSPY Weekly levels   \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5 -> 381.7  \n Support- 418.6 -> 411.6 -> 407.7  \n Resistance- 422 -> 427.4 -> 431.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu2oa9jq392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2adcd265f3cecb15fea8db51121a5e2ae917b868\n\nOn the daily chart here for futures we did have one demand left at 4198 and we officially with establishing a new demand (support) at that critical 4156 area actually have just opened the door to the upside in a big way. \n\nWith a daily closure over 4208/4216 supply our next logical upside target is 4311. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji8qvi1r392b1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f730d5c7b1c72902cdbc9c94c4a7f8030d54e77d\n\nFutures weekly is the same story as spy\u2026 we attempted to put in a new weekly supply and we also attempted to lose 4130 demand for a while. However as it would be the bulls bounced us right off 4130 demand and now have closed us over 4193 supply. With this move up and the weekly DMI moving up along with no new weekly supply\u2026 our favoritism here would be to test 4284 and if we break through that the next major level is all the way up at 4540. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8b3pz7mr392b1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d0f8f04288ab06a68d8ace22c02003fa4411b21\n\nLooking at the daily here on futures we are currently sitting in our 4075 to 4310 channel. Being that we are pushing up that leaves our upside target as 4310. Our rising wedge structure on futures is much different than SPY when we come to resistance but the same support wise. Currently the red rising wedge resistance sits at 4235 for Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6g4ofg2s392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b3ae3af89f3e67697b70afbf011be10f9854257\n\nOn the weekly here you can see that we have the same structure as SPY weekly with the blue rising wedge that slightly bigger followed by the black one. We are now sitting in this 4280 to 4135 channel. Being that we back test the weekly 8ema and 4135 support and was able to hold that shows that we are still bullish here. The black resistance sits at 4243 and the blue rising wedge sits at 4268 for next week. \n\nOne interesting thing I follow is the JPM collar 7/ 11 week movement. As I said is that usually week 7 to 11 reverses\u2026 however, in the chance that the trend does not reverse (which appears to be what is happening right now) then we usually actually see that trend continue even more aggressively. That would mean a potential 3 long bull run could be starting here. \n\nThat would mean our target is 4300 which is the current JPM collars calls. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4193 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4184 -> 4132 -> 4075  \n Resistance- 4230 -> 4283 -> 4328\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1f97tis392b1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e37963a0ece9f7f748083adacde0bbc972e01494\n\nLooking at QQQ daily here we absolutely have rocketed since we put in that 331.35 demand. We now are starting to knock on the door of that 351.57 demand now. \n\nIf this momentum continues which daily DMI and extreme bull momentum says it should we then should start to looked 351.57 demand -> 357.09 supply and finally the ultimate target of 361.7 demand. \n\nHowever, if we were to retrace at all we should find some major support at the 336.37 to 337.6. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e10lvl3t392b1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8efd0f696c32561732032f6c03e18c37118c278a\n\nFrom the weekly stand point here this charts actually is just insane its pretty much just vertical for the last 2 months now. \n\nThe bears once again were not able to put in a new weekly supply and the DMI remains waving up with extreme bull momentum. The weekly 8ema which will be around 330.67 next week should once again be considered strong support. \n\nAs of right now the target remains 361.85 and if we happen to go on that 3 week bull run or a blow off top my target is 382.9/ 384.54 demands.\n\nQQQ Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 361.85 -> 330.67 -> 318.64 -> 306.06  \n Demand- 384.54 -> 382.9 -> 322.47 -> 318.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65edf4kt392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=654b5d07fb5ddb09a90a3467df2bc2df251883ad\n\nNow here on the VIX we also put a new carrot top in\u2026 the one really interesting thing to me here is the fact that the VIX dumped pretty aggressively all morning and we saw almost -10% at one point and I thought we were going to approach the 16.92 support area\u2026 however, what happened that was very interesting is that the VIX actually continued to rise today even though SPY was rising. \n\nThere was a lot of oddities about today trading but the biggest one remains that from pretty much 1130 until EOD the VIX continued to hold flat and then began to rise\u2026 however, SPY also began to rise. It definitely is a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t occur often and makes trading hard. \n\nThe VIX closed at 17.95 just under that critical 17.97 support. I will be watching Tuesday to see if the VIX continues to sell off or not. \n\nThe VIX most certainly was reacting (the market) to the fact that a debt ceiling agreement has NOT been reached and as far as I know they are about to go to recess and will not be back in session until Tuesday. Which means according to Yellen if we run out on the 1st that they will have essentially two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) to come to an agreement\u2026 \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fypqqkzt392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa0ebd1a2c5475310d54a135a904d3044a1e421d\n\nNow I follow the 10yr and DXY every day but I don\u2019t really talk about it every day\u2026 but I do find it very interesting that DXY and 10YR both are in the exact same bull channel since the 2nd week of May. \n\nWhat I also find interesting is that DXY and 10YR daily look like a massive cup and handle which means DXY should hit 105.13 to 105.63 again and 10YR should hit 4.011% to 4.049% again. \n\nWhat really is odd about this is the fact that the last time DXY was at this level was March 13th to March 17th, February 16th to February 23rd, and December 13th to January 6th. \n\nSpy traded (at close) 385.36 to 389.99, 408.28 to 400.66 and 401.97 to 388.08 during those time periods for an average SPY closing price of 395.67. That means with our closure at 420.02 SPY is trading 6.1% higher than it was when DXY has traded at these levels in the past or about $25. \n\nThe last time the 10YR was at these levels was March 10th, February 10th to 15th, January 3rd to 5th and December 23rd. During those time periods SPY traded at close at 385.91, 408.04 to 413.98, 380.82 to 379.38 and 382.91. For an average at close trade price of 389.98 which is about $30 higher than current close or 7.7% higher. \n\nWhat does that mean? Well it could mean everything or it could mean nothing\u2026 I just find it interesting that over the last 6 months when the 10YR and DXY have been at these levels historically SPY has been trading much much lower. It also is very odd to watch the 10YR and DYX continue to rise each day as SPY and TECH continues to rise\u2026 \n\nThis all feels very much like something is going to break and its going to break in a big big way\u2026 the question is just when. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\nToday was another tough day of trading for me and I ended up closing out a small red day. The last month or so now I have found it extremely difficult for me to remain profitable on Thursday and Fridays. I seem to be in this cycle of absolutely killing it on Monday through Wednesday and then struggling like crazy on Thursday/ Friday. \n\nHonestly for me it all comes down to my strategy. My strategy as I have mentioned relies on the technicals of the market. I do not share my full strat but some things I look at and put a ton of weigh in is momentum, DMI, VOLD and VIX. The hardest part about these explosive rallies we have had lately is the fact that those metrics are not aligning. The other hard part is that there is times where after the huge run up where the technicals will point to a perfect put entry\u2026 of course I take that and the issue is that the techncials immediately cycle but little to no movement is ever had. \n\nThe other issue is that it seems like lately premiums at least the last two days for sure have completely lagged moves. I know this morning I played two puts and a call. None of those seemed despite winning on all three to pay any decent reward. I had a few mid day plays too some I closed small wins/ loss and others I stopped that for the size of the move that happened the premium did not reward us very much at all\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhz6r09v392b1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46a5a056fb99f5fec3d9b7040c6442b7224737cc\n\nI actually did close out my most profitable week of the year again and this is now my 8th green week ibn a row making it my longest win streak of 2023 and my 2nd longest of the last 2 years. \n\nOne interesting this is that this is also my 2nd lowest weekly win rate of 2023. I had a great beginning of the week but lately as I have said I struggled to close. \n\nI have a really nice 3 day weekend again and I have a few things I would like to back test and I have the time to do it. I have one more indicator I use and have on my charts all day as I trade but I don\u2019t necessarily use it on every entry\u2026 I am considering if its time to put more weight into it\u2026 but I will not be able to do that until I back test\u2026 \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and for any of you who have had a someone you know whether a friend or family member serve and lost their lives defending our country\u2026 I truly thank you for your sacrifice. See you guys Tuesday!",

Markets priced in a bunch of rate cuts by EOY (100bps cuts at one point but for the most part it was 75bps) and that sent the markets absolutely rallying\u2026\n\nNow look at this\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zz3tzxf292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3eecde1daf44217102f585f046257a9f47193799\n\nIn the last week the markets have went from a 17.4% odds of a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting to now a 71.1% chance of a rate hike\u2026 yet what happened this week? We rallied..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4skx0yeg292b1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1efd0606e4d1038f89c4bdf4c1d4e015d5e14e3\n\nNow not only that\u2026 but the markets went from just one week ago today pricing in a 44.7% odds of 75bps rate CUTS by end of year to now pricing in 39.4% odds (the highest odds) that we do not see any rate cuts by end of year\u2026\n\nNow I know markets can be a bit wacky\u2026 but how does it make sense that the markets went from expecting a fed pause and 75bps of rate CUTS by end of year to now expecting 25bps of rate HIKES next meeting and NO CUTS in one week and that week closes green on SPY?\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioj7hwug292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eade7000993438ab102dffbc0d87b6cedc9ae1cd\n\nOn the Daily we officially established a new demand (support) at 414.55. As I suspected if we pushed higher we would indeed make a new demand. The daily DMI is now waving higher and we have a new demand with bullish weekly support\u2026 the upside is what I would be looking for here and there is no real sense in shorting SPY right now. \n\nWe also closed over 418.78 and 419.5 supply\u2026 this means until we put a new supply in and we would need two red days back to back to do that our target remains the 429.68 area I pointed out last Friday. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6em1p7gh292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=039edc470710c16059fb26c6ed31d5e9fffe3916\n\nOn a weekly time frame here the bears actually put up a REALLY big fight and until today the weekly was going to make a new supply and at one point we attempted to set up a closure below the weekly 411.46 demand. Nonetheless though bulls pushed us and we now sit over the 416.09 weekly supply after retesting support of the 411.46 demand. The weekly DMI continues to wave up and we also continue to push higher with no new weekly supply\u2026\n\nOur target remains 427.35 and in the chance we blow through that roof I have no major supply level until 453.23. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqc4yjvh292b1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c9a75f31c6247f77f5f203e618d77ff8843b853\n\nAs you can see from the daily here we once action have made a new lower rising wedge support (this has been a theme for a while now). We also had a very nice v bottom off of 410.53 and we have for the first time since August closed over 419.5 resistance. Its not pictured here but this orange channel has a upper resistance of 427.5. As of right now that is the bulls target. \n\nWe will keep a close eye on that red rising wedge though as this resistance could still with 3 touches hold as resistance into next week. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szf7dm9i292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce33d0f981be02e49c07259d241af7ff44a415e4\n\nAs you can see we are in a bigger blue rising wedge that days back to September and we are also in more of a short term black/ blue rising wedge.\n\nThis blue rising wedge resistance is all the way up at 434.27 for next week and shows a clear path to 430-440 by end of June. The black rising wedge resistance sits at 425.4 for next week. The way this weekly candle with the very long wick bounce off the weekly 8ema is makes me believe in continuation to the upside for next week. \n\nSPY Weekly levels   \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5 -> 381.7  \n Support- 418.6 -> 411.6 -> 407.7  \n Resistance- 422 -> 427.4 -> 431.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqa402pi292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c390ef92761d2bca397c3b37ea1f37d424cfece9\n\nOn the daily chart here for futures we did have one demand left at 4198 and we officially with establishing a new demand (support) at that critical 4156 area actually have just opened the door to the upside in a big way. \n\nWith a daily closure over 4208/4216 supply our next logical upside target is 4311. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7n40l6j292b1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac8eb806fe60422dc6f8bedaedeaffaaa85d62e3\n\nFutures weekly is the same story as spy\u2026 we attempted to put in a new weekly supply and we also attempted to lose 4130 demand for a while. However as it would be the bulls bounced us right off 4130 demand and now have closed us over 4193 supply. With this move up and the weekly DMI moving up along with no new weekly supply\u2026 our favoritism here would be to test 4284 and if we break through that the next major level is all the way up at 4540. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3esl1cnj292b1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdf1ba368fc0c371618787b435703ba46b8442d0\n\nLooking at the daily here on futures we are currently sitting in our 4075 to 4310 channel. Being that we are pushing up that leaves our upside target as 4310. Our rising wedge structure on futures is much different than SPY when we come to resistance but the same support wise. Currently the red rising wedge resistance sits at 4235 for Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u69lzi3k292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb0ce6caba041244dd4e219ac5291bb68d7b058c\n\nOn the weekly here you can see that we have the same structure as SPY weekly with the blue rising wedge that slightly bigger followed by the black one. We are now sitting in this 4280 to 4135 channel. Being that we back test the weekly 8ema and 4135 support and was able to hold that shows that we are still bullish here. The black resistance sits at 4243 and the blue rising wedge sits at 4268 for next week. \n\nOne interesting thing I follow is the JPM collar 7/ 11 week movement. As I said is that usually week 7 to 11 reverses\u2026 however, in the chance that the trend does not reverse (which appears to be what is happening right now) then we usually actually see that trend continue even more aggressively. That would mean a potential 3 long bull run could be starting here. \n\nThat would mean our target is 4300 which is the current JPM collars calls. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4193 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4184 -> 4132 -> 4075  \n Resistance- 4230 -> 4283 -> 4328\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq4mlrmk292b1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d2df51c33ea8cb8576188b32b689dd4397a4b21\n\nLooking at QQQ daily here we absolutely have rocketed since we put in that 331.35 demand. We now are starting to knock on the door of that 351.57 demand now. \n\nIf this momentum continues which daily DMI and extreme bull momentum says it should we then should start to looked 351.57 demand -> 357.09 supply and finally the ultimate target of 361.7 demand. \n\nHowever, if we were to retrace at all we should find some major support at the 336.37 to 337.6. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/008lc44l292b1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4d8ed1faea00c2dd58260d1903efce4531c195a\n\nFrom the weekly stand point here this charts actually is just insane its pretty much just vertical for the last 2 months now. \n\nThe bears once again were not able to put in a new weekly supply and the DMI remains waving up with extreme bull momentum. The weekly 8ema which will be around 330.67 next week should once again be considered strong support. \n\nAs of right now the target remains 361.85 and if we happen to go on that 3 week bull run or a blow off top my target is 382.9/ 384.54 demands.\n\nQQQ Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 361.85 -> 330.67 -> 318.64 -> 306.06  \n Demand- 384.54 -> 382.9 -> 322.47 -> 318.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3583bykl292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6bc8d33bc77a29ef12c24dca3a62cf2aab4d608d\n\nNow here on the VIX we also put a new carrot top in\u2026 the one really interesting thing to me here is the fact that the VIX dumped pretty aggressively all morning and we saw almost -10% at one point and I thought we were going to approach the 16.92 support area\u2026 however, what happened that was very interesting is that the VIX actually continued to rise today even though SPY was rising. \n\nThere was a lot of oddities about today trading but the biggest one remains that from pretty much 1130 until EOD the VIX continued to hold flat and then began to rise\u2026 however, SPY also began to rise. It definitely is a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t occur often and makes trading hard. \n\nThe VIX closed at 17.95 just under that critical 17.97 support. I will be watching Tuesday to see if the VIX continues to sell off or not. \n\nThe VIX most certainly was reacting (the market) to the fact that a debt ceiling agreement has NOT been reached and as far as I know they are about to go to recess and will not be back in session until Tuesday. Which means according to Yellen if we run out on the 1st that they will have essentially two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) to come to an agreement\u2026 \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eemhb0m292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc15b397b0569b0c16361a8397efc60364cdeb8c\n\nNow I follow the 10yr and DXY every day but I don\u2019t really talk about it every day\u2026 but I do find it very interesting that DXY and 10YR both are in the exact same bull channel since the 2nd week of May. \n\nWhat I also find interesting is that DXY and 10YR daily look like a massive cup and handle which means DXY should hit 105.13 to 105.63 again and 10YR should hit 4.011% to 4.049% again. \n\nWhat really is odd about this is the fact that the last time DXY was at this level was March 13th to March 17th, February 16th to February 23rd, and December 13th to January 6th. \n\nSpy traded (at close) 385.36 to 389.99, 408.28 to 400.66 and 401.97 to 388.08 during those time periods for an average SPY closing price of 395.67. That means with our closure at 420.02 SPY is trading 6.1% higher than it was when DXY has traded at these levels in the past or about $25. \n\nThe last time the 10YR was at these levels was March 10th, February 10th to 15th, January 3rd to 5th and December 23rd. During those time periods SPY traded at close at 385.91, 408.04 to 413.98, 380.82 to 379.38 and 382.91. For an average at close trade price of 389.98 which is about $30 higher than current close or 7.7% higher. \n\nWhat does that mean? Well it could mean everything or it could mean nothing\u2026 I just find it interesting that over the last 6 months when the 10YR and DXY have been at these levels historically SPY has been trading much much lower. It also is very odd to watch the 10YR and DYX continue to rise each day as SPY and TECH continues to rise\u2026 \n\nThis all feels very much like something is going to break and its going to break in a big big way\u2026 the question is just when. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\nToday was another tough day of trading for me and I ended up closing out a small red day. The last month or so now I have found it extremely difficult for me to remain profitable on Thursday and Fridays. I seem to be in this cycle of absolutely killing it on Monday through Wednesday and then struggling like crazy on Thursday/ Friday. \n\nHonestly for me it all comes down to my strategy. My strategy as I have mentioned relies on the technicals of the market. I do not share my full strat but some things I look at and put a ton of weigh in is momentum, DMI, VOLD and VIX. The hardest part about these explosive rallies we have had lately is the fact that those metrics are not aligning. The other hard part is that there is times where after the huge run up where the technicals will point to a perfect put entry\u2026 of course I take that and the issue is that the techncials immediately cycle but little to no movement is ever had. \n\nThe other issue is that it seems like lately premiums at least the last two days for sure have completely lagged moves. I know this morning I played two puts and a call. None of those seemed despite winning on all three to pay any decent reward. I had a few mid day plays too some I closed small wins/ loss and others I stopped that for the size of the move that happened the premium did not reward us very much at all\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i7l73jm292b1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7af14251eb9addddf08cb9f0934aa2ecd9bd0692\n\nI actually did close out my most profitable week of the year again and this is now my 8th green week ibn a row making it my longest win streak of 2023 and my 2nd longest of the last 2 years. \n\nOne interesting this is that this is also my 2nd lowest weekly win rate of 2023. I had a great beginning of the week but lately as I have said I struggled to close. \n\nI have a really nice 3 day weekend again and I have a few things I would like to back test and I have the time to do it. I have one more indicator I use and have on my charts all day as I trade but I don\u2019t necessarily use it on every entry\u2026 I am considering if its time to put more weight into it\u2026 but I will not be able to do that until I back test\u2026 \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and for any of you who have had a someone you know whether a friend or family member serve and lost their lives defending our country\u2026 I truly thank you for your sacrifice. See you guys Tuesday!",

        "selftext": "Anyone remember AMD back in 2012-2015? I remember buying in when it was about $3 (a whole $50 at the time) and following it as earnings came in and the company was on a positive track but the stock kept going down. The upsides with Crypto, Machine Learning, and other processing power heavy technologies just around the corner yet the stock continued to be barely hanging on to life, then  suddenly the stock took off as it began to show the earnings reported weren't temporary but long-term strategic growths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm looking at SPCE with similar vibes, here's why.\n\nJust a few years ago Space Tourism was predicted to be a growing and potential multi-billion dollar per year industry.\n\nHere's some charts because we all like pictures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2i7wr1a1z82b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fcacfa97145c62d2c624c53e1d880b3e02f7f6bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn0d0p42z82b1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=836ae96bef9b557c59ec7d03b51b8fa54f00cec7\n\nBut why SPCE? Why not AMZN or SpaceX?\n\nIt all comes down to: Affordability, Availability, and Astronaut-ability.\n\n# Affordability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Ticket Price: **$450,000** (Target market: Millionaires)\n* Blue Origin Ticket Price: **$1,250,000** (Target market: Multi-millionaires)\n* SpaceX Ticket Price: **$55,000,000** (Target market: Governments & Billionaires)\n\n# Availability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Yearly Capacity: 400 Flights (planned) / 2,400 Persons\n* Blue Origin Yearly Capacity: 52 Flights (estimate) / 312 Persons\n* SpaceX Yearly Capacity: 61 Flights (proven) / 427 Persons\n\n# Astronaut-ability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* Blue Origin flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* SpaceX flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n\nThat's right, they all qualify! The FUD over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line is pure marketing by Blue Origin and SpaceX as well as SPCE bears. The FAA recognizes commercial astronauts (tourists) **who fly to a height of 50 miles or higher.** (see below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjf86qh3z82b1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b72d5c11673ca30c7d8348cb499a19a0ce72b44\n\nLink: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\\_astronaut#:\\~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut#:~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission).\n\nSo in summary it's the millionaire version of the Lady & Lord established title thing, except it's real.\n\nWhy go to school for 6 years and be a Doctor if you could add \"astronaut\" to the end of everything for the same amount of money? If someone is willing to throw out millions on a yacht slightly larger than their peers, why won't they drop the money on a spaceflight?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all brings me back to why the stock is tanking, they just had a successful test flight of their new craft and the stock is down 15% today. Maybe it's \"priced in\" but my guess is that the FUD is getting laid on thick since it is becoming likely that SPCE will be a serious market competitor, potentially taking sales away from Blue Origin or SpaceX, but the reality is that the market is so much larger than current  capacity ([https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel)) and it will take decades to saturate that market. Virgin Galactic is the only relatively affordable spaceflight option right now and if it goes away, space tourism will be a thing only accessible by the ultra-wealthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I like the stock, but I'm probably regarded, so that's why I like it. Or maybe I've had too much caffeine today. This is not financial advice, this is the dumpster behind a wendys.\n\nPS: I wish I could flair this \"shallow dive\" as I'm not that smart on stocks, I still own the stock that must not be named\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.",

But if a deal isn't reached, those poor suckers might not get their money back for who knows how long!\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sifma expects the Treasury to take it day by day, announcing plans to extend the life of bonds that are supposed to mature on the day before. It's all about keeping the show going, you know?\n\n\ud83d\udca5 But here's the thing, if the Treasury messes up and a bond matures without getting paid, it's gonna cause chaos in the Fedwire system. That could freeze billions of dollars in assets overnight and seriously make people question if the US government has any credibility left.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f This debt-ceiling mess could have all sorts of crazy consequences. It might trigger a full-blown financial crisis and who knows what else. The SEC chair is warning that those hedge fund guys have been borrowing like crazy in the Treasury market, and that's a risk to all of us regular folks.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Remember back in 2011 when S&P downgraded the US credit rating? Well, analysts are worried that more downgrades could happen, and that would seriously shake confidence in the US government. Wall Street would feel the pain, and the government and taxpayers might end up paying more in interest.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The US Treasury's cash on hand isn't looking too great. They've got an account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account, but it's almost $900 billion lighter than last year. Not a good sign.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 This debt-ceiling crap is already messing with the bond market. The Treasury has been issuing fewer short-term Treasury bills, which screwed up trading and caused crazy fluctuations in rates. People are flocking to safe assets like Treasurys, expecting them to rally big time.\n\n Wall Street and the global financial system are on the edge of a freaking cliff.  Ditched my NVDA and AMD holdings on Thursday and made some sweet tendies. It's time to GTFO before this shit show gets real. You better do the same, my fellow degenerates! \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude80",

They let the Taiwanese surpass them using technology that Intel itself was a primary player in developing/funding (EUV machines via ASML). Intel has recently hired a new CEO that while on the surface seems brain dead, is actually a legendary engineer who has Intel on the path to take back leadership in process nodes with 18A. Essentially, they will likely have the fastest/most energy efficient chips in the world in 2024 or 2025.\n\n2) AI - A lot of mouth breathers out there believe that Nvidia will be the only player in AI. They don\u2019t understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt). Their GPU hardware is legit and their most recent data center max is outperforming the Nvidia flagship H100 by 30% across many workloads. \n\n3) Gaming - Gamers hate Nvidia for constantly raising prices while giving shittier performance per $. Intel ARC GPUs will erode market share in a big way over time. I expect the next model, battlemage, to take significant share from Nvidia as the performance per $ will be unbelievable. \n\n4) Foundry services - Intel is the only leading edge chip manufacturer in the West. As tensions continue to heat up over Taiwan, more and more companies will have Intel manufacturing their designs at fabs in the US. Intel will likely surpass Samsung as the #2 fab in the world by 2030.\n\n5) Western Governments - Fabs are the next oil and Intel is the only game in town for the west when it comes to bleeding edge. I expect the majority of the chips act to go to Intel. Same with the European chips bill. These bills won\u2019t be one offs either. Intel has a monopoly on Western leading edge chips and will get all of the government contracts, grants, funding, etc associated with that.\n\n6) Taiwan - If something happens in Taiwan, even a simple blockade, I would expect the majority of fabless producers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, etc) to come running to Intel. If things get heated between the US and China, the US could ensure that all chips for important industries (healthcare, banking, etc) be manufactured in the United States.\n\nThese are just the top six reasons why Intel is generationally cheap. \n\nI would load up on 2025 leaps and keep rolling them back.",

        "selftext": "For those of you hiding in a box, the debt limit is a dumb law that Congress kind of passed accidentally when they consolidated the federal budget into a single thing.\n\nSo now, in our dumb laws, there are two spending limits. The first is the budget of Congress sets, and then there is the maximum amount of debt that the US is allowed to incur. Since Congress has already voted to spend more money than we have, we are running up against the debt limit. This is literally just a thing to authorize us to spend the money that we already agreed to spend. It is very dumb.\n\nOkay, we got out of the way, how do we make money off of this dumb thing?\n\nThe closer we get to failing to raise the debt limit the crazier the stock market gets. High volatility is hard to bet on either way because you have to get the direction right, but volatility itself is pretty easy to bet on. You just buy calls for VIX. It tracks stock market volatility. If you had bought it just as the covid pandemic was starting in December 2019 you would have made an ass load of money. \n\nIdeally, you want these calls dated sometime in mid-june so that you can sell them during the last minute negotiations when the debt limit will almost have been hit but not quite have been hit. The vix almost certainly dropped down much lower once Congress gets back together and raises the debt limit. You might even want to save some of the calls and see if we smash through the debt limit, in which case they will probably become even more valuable. I would guess there's only a 25% chance that we actually default on debt so the safer play is to sell them when they're high.\n\nOther alternatives, especially if you are just hoping to ride the wave of a herd mentality, is to jump into a gold ETF like ishares whatever. This will likely spike at some point, but hasn't moved much yet so who knows? \n\nThose are my two plays, I'm curious what the rest of you are thinking to hedge against this or make money off of it.",

Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.\n\nNvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (\u00a3760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.\n\nNvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities said Nvidia \"absolutely blew away prior expectations\u201d.\n\nMark Lipacis from Jefferies bank believes that Nvidia\u2019s growing data centre revenues could even surpass the combined sales of central processing units from Intel and AMD, two of the stalwart chipmaker.\n\nBut it's not just about the numbers; it's about the future. Nvidia is at the forefront of AI, the big trend that everyone and their grandmother wants to get into. Companies are scrambling to integrate AI into their businesses, and that's a goldmine for Nvidia. They make the hardware needed to run the complex AI models, and they're ramping up their supply to meet the surging demand.\n\nHowever, with all great opportunities come challenges. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced concerns over trade restrictions that could cause \"enormous damage.\" The geopolitics of the US and China are increasingly affecting chip companies, but Nvidia is still going strong.\n\nIn summary, Nvidia's booming business and its strategic position in the rapidly growing AI market make it a stock worth watching for all of us here at Wallstreetbets. Keep in mind that the rocket ride might have its bumps due to geopolitical factors, but as we know, that's all part of the journey to the moon.\n\nP.S -this isn't financial advice. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nP.P.S. - \"Stonks only go up\" is an investment strategy",

Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   \nBut I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. \n\nThe hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none.

And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   \n\n\nIt's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   \nIf you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, \"Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel.\" You said, \"fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!\"   \nAnd that's still the America I believe in.

But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost.

There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. \n\nWhat the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!\n\nMany current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*\n\nThe first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA.

        "selftext": "I'm gonna pack this down to a simple concept - \"Money prices.\" I'm gonna skip trying to mansplain what (I think) money prices are, but in a nutshell, think of dark pool trades that occur at a price that differs from where spot is trading (or, where it HAS traded). \n\nFor example, \n\nDate     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/25 | QQQ  | 12:56:00 | 339.98 | 0.24  | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD |  $ PRICE ($340.57) TA > HOD (340.32)\n\nTA = \"Trading above.\" Since this post won't have any charts/pictures to put everything more into perspective,, I recommend pulling up a chart if you wana follow along. If there's one thing I've learned over the past few years, it's that \"money prices\" fill; always. We're 19 (trading) days into May, and so far, there's been 52 TA > HOD (money prices that hit ABOVE spot price HOD) for $QQQ. Although these prices <always> fill, it's not always as easy as today where you can nail a .17% move in 20 minutes. QQQ has always been the golden child of money prices (in terms of time-taken-to-fill). There are absolutely circumstances (if money price > ATH, 52wk low, or shows BIG % move > .35%) where 'filling' a money price, doesn't happen within the hour, day, or week. Another example being today where QQQ hit $338.86 -- from Monday (after having sold off almost -1.75% from that point), or SPY hitting lows -2% since last Friday after seeing $422.69. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/22 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 337.64 | 0.41 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($338.86) TA > HOD (338.67)      \n\nor \n\n05/19 | SPY | 10:29:00 | 420.59 | 0.1 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($422.69) TA > HOD (420.72)   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 golden rules to money prices. 1. They always fill. 2. Even under the most extreme circumstances (esp SPY/QQQ), I've never seen it take longer than 3 months for one to fill. Now, in 2022, things got... I'm not even sure the word. But, now is when I'd really pull up a chart to follow along.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate               Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/24/2022 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 329.60 | 3.22 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($330.85) TA > HOD (330.29)\n\n06/02/2022 | SPY | 11:48:00 | 412.74 | 0.81 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($412.96) TA > HOD (412.86)  \n\n06/02/2022 | SPY | 15:59:00 | 417.39 | 1.95 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($418.35) TA > HOD (417.44)\n\nWhere were we 3 months later, in August of 2022? This was the first time I've ever seen regular TA prices (where, they're NOT above a stock's ATH. Just above HOD/Weekly high) that it's taken this amount of time. Nonetheless, 3 months. If you haven't noticed, this type of arbitrage is typically somewhere around a .15% - .35% move to where spot price is trading. Even a .30% move is on the more-extreme side. But like I said, 2022 got..... idk the word. These next instances are 07/22/2022 - don't mean to spam the length of this, but to clarify the fact that these prices aren't gimmicks, imagine seeing back2back2back2back money prices claiming that next .15% move lower -- \n\n........................................and then nuking it -14%. \n\nDate               Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ |13:27:00 | 301.08 | -1.75 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.55) TB < LOD (301.01) \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 13:33:00 | 300.99 -1.78 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.7) TB < LOD (300.84)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 13:42:00 | 300.75 -1.85 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($297.46) TB < LOD (300.42)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 14:07:00 | 300.67 -1.88 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.39) TB < LOD (300.42)  \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 14:45:00 | 300.29 -2.00 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($266.93) TB < LOD (300.11)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 15:08:00 | 300.84 -1.82 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($256.69) TB < LOD (300.11) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all..... FOURTEEN f\\*\\*\\* percent???? I've never seen anything like it - not even close. Not even semi-close to a fraction. Nowhere near that. And TWICE? TWO OF THEM? WTF? Again..... if you're a good noodle, and you have a chart open of $QQQ, tell me: where were we within the next 3 months? Over the past 4 years, I can count on 1 hand the # of times I've seen it take > 1 month for something to fill, so 2022 has really made me speculate whether those types of instances could be tied to option expiration? Quarterlies? Just straight up unusual/extreme instances? I wish I knew, but I don't. Regardless, I've been doing this long enough to understand just how near & dear money prices are to the market. Even if time is a negating factor, it doesn't stand in the way for long. That being said, lets get to the kicker.\n\nIn June of 2022, a $340.21 money price hit for $SPY. Nearly -7%. Again, I'm floored seeing one that extreme. F\\*\\*\\* outside THE REALM of extreme. \n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n06/22/2022 | SPY | 09:34:00 | 369.83 | -0.18  | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($369.77) TB < LOD (369.8)\n\n06/22/2022| SPY | 15:03:00 | 365.82 | -1.27 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($340.21) TB < LOD (364.08)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're now, 1 month away to the 1 year mark of seeing that. Not only did SPY (unlike $QQQ) NOT fill that extreme 52wk low, but we're +11% since, and 17% away from $340.21. Maybe, just MAYBE................. maybe, that has to be a gimmick? MAYBE? For the first time EVER? Because if THAT was a gimmick, maybe this one is too? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n12/14/2022 | QQQ | 14:01:00 | 288.79 | 0.25 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($249.77) TB < LOD (287.28) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody calls for a 1987 type crash. Even if they did - they'd be crazy. I'd call them crazy. Am I calling for a 1987 type crash? No. I'm just saying, it's not off the table. It's not off the table at all. As of right now, $SPY has $422.69 to fill, & $QQQ has $341.42. The market will go higher (I'm edumucated guessing + hoping) those get touched so our T's get crossed & our i's dotted. There's no crash flashy enough that isn't warranted for SPY + QQQ to break the lows we made late last year. The closer we get to 06/16/2023, the more I'm anticipating the unthinkable.",

However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.\n\nThis led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA, SNOW, CRM)\n\nThis led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. \n\nThis also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven\u2019t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn\u2019t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don\u2019t without suffering major losses. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68\n\nAs of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today\u2026 we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)\u2026 so this means 1 of 2 things\u2026 first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below\u2026 OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. \n\nNow when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. \n\nFrom a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. \n\nThe ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2ge4o7tq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a311c28180c7002eec379a170a17acc732a95218\n\nPrice action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). \n\nFrom a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  \n Demand- 410.2  \n Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   \n Resistance- 417 -> 418.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dje99ntq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4231c8854754e7512c41c0983c132a2faa5b4657\n\nFrom a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here\u2026 however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. \n\nIf we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wtuyn1uq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf8e4946912109fdc651a74db695e51f5b489a7\n\nOn futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).\n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  \n Demand- 4198 -> 4128  \n Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208\n\n**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3\n\nNow this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY\u2026 here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal\u2026 in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. \n\nThe one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too\u2026 The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99\n\n**VIX** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7hbrq5vq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3de28101d61d7ad29bd02af4019de508804ae47c\n\nAs I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx3vo5jvq12b1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88585d6e1ee3a7a1bde23f23cecdeff855b7a3fc\n\nHonestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. \n\nI also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn\u2019t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. \n\nTough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, shares his thoughts on the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling debate. His central point is that both increasing and not increasing the debt limit will have disastrous consequences. A smart bipartisan plan that reforms the system and focuses on productivity could prevent a terrible outcome.\n\nLikely Outcome: Dalio predicts that Democrats and Republicans will avoid a long-term default and instead adopt short-term solutions that won't address the core issues. Dalio argues against this approach.\n\nDalio's Background: Dalio's perspective is shaped by his role as a global macro investor, focusing on five major forces: money/credit/economy, politics, geopolitics, natural events, and learning/technology. For him, political polarization is currently the greatest threat to sound decision-making.\n\nThe Political Landscape: According to Dalio, three political \"types\" exist today: the hard-right, the hard-left, and the bipartisan moderate. Dalio identifies as a bipartisan moderate and warns that extreme polarization will intensify conflicts, possibly leading to a non-violent \"civil war\".\n\nRisks of Increasing the Debt Limit: If the debt limit is repeatedly raised without restrictions, Dalio sees a potential for a financial collapse. The endless cycle of spending more than one earns and covering it with debt is unsustainable and could lead to a debt crisis.\n\nRisks of Not Increasing the Debt Limit: On the other hand, failing to raise the debt limit could result in default or cutbacks for those least able to afford them, causing financial and social upheaval.\n\nSolution: Dalio believes that a smart bipartisan plan that comprehensively addresses the U.S.'s financial, economic, and national debt issues is necessary. Swiftly settling the debt issue without addressing the root causes is not a sustainable solution.\n\nThe Battle: Dalio suggests that the fight between moderates willing to compromise and extremists who aren't needs to happen. It's time for moderate leaders from both parties to band together and challenge the extremes in their parties.\n\nReforming Capitalism: Dalio also stresses the importance of reforming capitalism to ensure collective earnings exceed spending. He believes productivity - often neglected - is key to improving incomes without reducing living standards. Both political sides should focus on productivity and fair distribution of benefits.\n\nConcluding Thoughts: Dalio insists his views aren't as important as the creation of a smart bipartisan plan by skilled moderates ready to fight extremists. This represents a chance for courageous moderates to band together and act, despite potential political costs.\n\nRemember, this is a summary of Dalio's article, meant to provide you with a quicker read while retaining the core of his argument. For a full understanding of his views, I encourage you to read the [original piece.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-should-done-debt-ceiling-argument-between-democrats-ray-dalio/?published=t)",

Beauty (ELF) on Wednesday posted [robust earnings and revenue that crushed estimates](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-elf-212503433.html), and provided full-year guidance that far outpaced Wall Street\u2019s expectations. While some retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW) are warning of a buyer slowdown, consumers seem to still want to shop for their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"We think its [Ulta\u2019s] comp growth remained strong driven by solid trends in both transactions and ticket growth,\u201d UBS analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a research note on May 11. \u201cWhile consumers\u2019 interest in makeup products has been picking up, self-care categories continue to perform well too.\u201d\n\nLasser rates the stock as a Buy with a $640 price target.\n\nSales of beauty products have historically performed well during economic downturns. This phenomena is known as the \u201clipstick index,\u201d and refers to the trend where makeup users continue to buy more affordable luxuries, even when their wallets are being pinched.\n\nBut there is room for concern. Inflation is still historically high, and there are clear signs that consumers are feeling the pressure. The University of Michigan recently said that May\u2019s preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to the lowest reading since November 2022.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh cut his price target on Ulta stock to $575 from $600 on May 19, but maintained his Outperform rating.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to prior quarters, we see limited EPS upside potential amidst an aggressive investment agenda, a slightly more promotional beauty backdrop, and a weakening retail discretionary landscape,\u201d he wrote in a research note at the time.\n\nI think the stock will do very well with earnings, so I'm gonna grab a call spread. The stock moves on average about 8% with earnings, so I'll pick something that has a maximum profitability at an 8% gain. This means getting the 5/26 500c ($1210) and selling the 525c ($550). I can grab the spread for $660, with a max profit of 279% if \"all goes well.\" Lol. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.",

        "title": "COST Earnings is Today! What are we gonna do?",
        "selftext": "Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results today, May 25. \n\nAnalysts estimate that Costco Wholesale will report earnings of $3.29 per share compared to earnings of $3.04 per share from the same quarter last year. They are also expecting the company to report $54.53 billion, an increase of 3.68% over the prior year quarter. As well as a profit of $14.40 per share this year. A year earlier, the company earned $13.14 per share.\n\nI expect Costco to likely beat the revenue and earnings expectations. It is worth pointing out that despite the pandemic and inflation, the business has managed to grow strongly. Consumers loaded up on essentials in high quantities to keep costs low. However, Costco\u2019s March 2023 sales data pointed to a potential slowdown for the business - with total comparable sales down 1.1% year-over-year (y-o-y), and e-commerce down 12.7% y-o-y. This marks the first time in multiple years that comps declined for the company, largely driven by rampant inflation. However, things improved a little in the April 2023 sales report - which saw its total comparable sales grow only slightly to 1.4%, and e-commerce was down 5.9%. Now that the company\u2019s monthly sales growth looks slow, investors might need to brace for potentially softer quarters ahead. The recent decline might be alarming but Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn\u2019t as important for it as it is for other retailers. The monthly reports do not include any information on Costco\u2019s profitability or segment and membership revenue breakup.\n\n**Revenues expected to be slightly ahead of consensus estimates**\n\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/) estimates COST\u2019s FQ3 2023 revenues to be $55.1 Billion, marginally higher than the consensus estimate mentioned earlier. In Q2, Costco\u2019s membership fee income was 6.2% higher than the prior-year period. And the renewal rate remained strong, at 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Even as degenerate gamblers, we need to keep an eye on this metric when calculating Costco\u2019s long-term growth potential. Also, Costco currently boasts nearly $14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Its long-term debt is only $6.5 billion, so Costco has a net cash position on its balance sheet. For the full-year 2023, we expect [Costco\u2019s Revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/COST/no-login-required/VPSnY8ac/Costco-Revenues-How-Does-COST-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230525) to grow 8% y-o-y to $245 billion.\n\nCostco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COST in this report.\n\n**EPS likely to match consensus estimates**\n\nCOST\u2019s FQ3 2023 earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 per Trefis analysis, almost matching the consensus estimate. In the second quarter, Costco\u2019s earnings per share rose from $2.92 (last year), despite supply chain pressure.\n\nA membership fee increase is unlikely this year because of high inflation, but it will happen sooner rather than later. Costco generally raises its membership fees every five years, last raised in 2017. This should help the company boost its bottom line further.\n\n**A membership fee increase may be coming**\n\nAnother potential catalyst that could increase COST shares is a membership fee increase. In the note, UBS Analyst Michael Lasser said now is the right time to raise fees, despite consumer wallets' being stretched. \"This will be a key focus this quarter. We think there's a good chance that COST will bump its Gold Star Membership fee by $5 and its Executive Membership fee by $10 either this quarter or next.\"\n\nLast quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, which is an 6.2% y-o-y increase as mentioned earlier. Costco last raised membership prices \u2014 a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120 \u2014 in June 2017. The company typically raises prices every 5 years and seven months on average, which suggests the next hike is imminent.\n\n**What to do for earnings?**\n\nDue to high strike prices, calls on this stock is kinda expensive. So I'm going to go for a call spread. The company has moved on average about \u00b14% with earnings, so I'll go for something that it's max profit at a 4% gain. This means buying the 5/26 490c for $510 and selling the 5/26 502.5c for $240. I can get the spread for $270 with a max gain of 4.6x if this goes my way (lol).",

        "selftext": "**Picture  IBM. Yeah, I'm talking about that old-as-dirt tech behemoth your  grandma's boyfriend probably worships. The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**\n\n**If  you haven\u2019t been paying attention, IBM\u2019s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with \u201cdisrupters\u201d like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM\u2019s MAIN FOCUS!**\n\n**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy\u2019s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend\u2019s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**\n\n**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin\u2019s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**\n\n**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**\n\n**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**\n\n**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend\u2019s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**",

That\u2019s about 7339 members per gym location. The Planet Fitness gyms near me have a max capacity of 360. How the heck can they get 7400 people in these locations. What am I missing here?\n\nOur Planet Fitness location just got all new MATRIX equipment after a major $1M renovation.  It looks like they are trying to cater to the Black Card memberships by expanding the massage chairs area, and tanning booth area.  No classrooms were added during the build out, empty floor space (floor mat routines) has been taken out.  Chatter amongst members indicate that the screens don't allow them to do their normal workouts, or limit what types of workouts can be done.  The MATRIX tech stated that Planet Fitness bought the lowest level screens available, and quipped, \"what do you expect for $10 month.\"  \n\nWith 18.1 million members at $10/month that's $181million gross per month.  How can a company as large as Planet Fitness not be able to negotiate better screens/software on the bulk purchases?  Are their numbers really not that great as RBC states?\n\nAre the franchisees being forced to upgrade per Franchise agreements and to their detriment, thus artificially increasing Planet Fitness equipment purchase numbers that they tout in their filings.  Is Planet Fitness selling bare bones equipment with high markups?\n\nCongress is considering legislation to make it easier to end gym memberships and force physical/in person renewals instead of automatic renewals. Many gyms require you to cancel membership or face (predatory) automatic renewal. Is this how Planet Fitness has so many members? What will this mean to their bottom line? RBC has upgraded theme, I think they\u2019re overhyped and I don\u2019t see growth or membership numbers that they\u2019re touting if they\u2019re relying on predatory default memberships.\n\nBased on my first-hand experience, I don't trust their numbers.  What the heck am I missing giving a high-end RBC price target of $115?  Should we expect in a year or two from now that they will have to restate their numbers?\n\nFairness FYI - I have memberships in Planet Fitness and One Life Fitness (business travel), and own PLNT in my portfolio.",

        "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/bill-ackman-says-icahn-somewhat-205128986.html\n\nPershing Square founder Bill Ackman has warned that his investment firm\u2019s rival, Icahn Enterprises, could prove to be another Archegos, a hedge fund whose spectacular 2021 implosion caused losses of over $10 billion for Wall Street banks.\n\nIn early May, Hindenburg Research accused the holding company and its famous controlling owner, Carl Icahn, of employing \u201cPonzi-like\u201d economics by paying off existing retail investors with unsustainably large dividends funded by new investors buying its stock exchange-listed depositary units.\n\n\nEver since the allegations were leveled by Hindenburg, which stated from the outset it was selling Icahn Enterprises short in a bet its price would fall, the holding has shed half its market value and is now worth $8.9 billion\u2014less than Ackman\u2019s $10 billion Pershing Square.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pershing Square billionaire said he was \u201cfascinated\u201d by the accusations and in particular the discovery of personal loans taken out by Icahn and secured against the depositary units in his eponymous investment holding, since it could prove highly unstable.\n\nThis, he said, \u201creminds me somewhat of Archegos\u201d, where Wall Street\u2019s prime brokers were left in the dark about just how much money their over-leveraged client was borrowing around town. \n\n\n\u201cIf Icahn were to sell any shares, the stock would likely drop precipitously as the overhang of additional sales and the further resulting loss in confidence would catalyze other shareholders to exit before the deluge,\u201d Ackman wrote.\n\n\n\nBill Hwang\u2019s Archegos family office collapsed like a house of cards two years ago, resulting in numerous banks losing money, most notably Credit Suisse. The Z\u00fcrich lender, caught holding the proverbial bag, suffered a $5.5 billion hit that helped cement its status as Europe\u2019s worst-managed bank and proved a key contributor to its ultimate downfall in March. \n\n\nHwang is now being prosecuted for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which warned that even a single hedge fund like Archegos \u201ccan have far-reaching implications for investors\u201d given enough banks willing to lend it money for speculation.\n\nIcahn Enterprises could not immediately be reached by Fortune for comment.\n\nAckman said he was neither long nor short on Icahn Enterprises, but merely was watching with interest from the sidelines how Icahn\u2019s precariously financed margin loans would play out.\n\n\n\u201cAll it takes is for one lender to break ranks and liquidate shares or attempt to hedge, before the house comes falling down,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe patsy is the last lender to liquidate.\u201d\n\nIcahn blames Federal Reserve\u2019s QE for his failed bets\n\nOn May 10, Icahn Enterprises reported it swung to a quarterly net loss of $270 million from a profit of $323 million a year earlier amid a negative return of 4.1%.\n\nDespite the poor Q1 performance, the sharp drop in the price of its depositary units and, most importantly, Hindenburg\u2019s allegations of impropriety, CEO David Willets ended the investor call after just 12 minutes following his team\u2019s scripted remarks. \u201cApparently there are no questions, we thank you for your time,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHindenburg went on the attack once more the following day after filings revealed that Icahn had now pledged nearly 203 million units against his margin loans, up from 181 million previously, representing a \u201cnear-term critical threat\u201c to unitholders.\n\n\u201cThe deal Icahn is making to retail investors is, essentially, \u2018buy ~$9 worth of value for ~$32 and I\u2019ll give you back $2 of your own money per quarter, for free\u2019,\u201d it wrote, referring to the quarterly dividend payout. The price of Icahn Enterprises\u2019 depositary units have since further declined, closing on Wednesday just below $24 each.\n\nA week later, an analysis by the Financial Times showed Icahn\u2019s investment portfolio had in fact lost money ever year since 2014. In the past six year alone, the newspaper found $6 billion in gains failed to offset $8.8 billion from losses on bearish bets. \n\nSpeaking to the FT, Icahn acknowledged he had made mistakes and failed to heed his own advice and trading strategies that would have limited his losses. \u201cI obviously believed the market was in for great trouble,\u201d he explained, adding he was foiled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing that helped bolster equity prices",

I'm still up a ton from where I started (\\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.\n\nThe worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  \n\nLet's look at the bright side (coping mechanism\ud83d\ude14):\n\n1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)\n2. I already took out and spent \\~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money\n3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.\n4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.\n5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.\n\nLessons/Mistakes:\n\n1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways\ud83d\ude13)\n2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.\n3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.\n4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.\n5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.\n6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.\n7. Next time around, if I do \"short\", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.\n8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.\n9. Probs a million other things\n\nDon't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point. \n\nGL frens WGMI \ud83d\ude0e",

People buy houses at 10-20x leverage, waive inspection, and go from tour to offer in 2 days. Job loss for either spouse could mean foreclosure. If the market doesn't appreciate quickly enough they will be underwater. Everything is a casino.",

        "selftext": "Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. \n\nLooking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early\u2026 With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high\u2026 However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone\u2026 so as much as they are enticing\u2026 not worth it to me. \n\nNow for those of you that don\u2019t know what the abandoned baby pattern is\u2026 it\u2019s a rarity and doesn\u2019t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up\u2026 May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern. \n\n**NVDA EARNINGS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn6c5tki1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c988280ee606e64ccaea21edca431ebff1ce1ecd\n\nThere is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then \u201cWOW.\u201d I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs\u2026 that truly is mindboggling. \n\nThis market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3\n\nNow from a supply and demand stand point we didn\u2019t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action\u2026 a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. \n\nWe did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. \n\nHonestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. \n\nHowever, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom\u2026. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6yl9mjj1v1b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=853a6d1a3e9b1c57946198621ba7d12481cc656e\n\nOn the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. \n\nWe will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally\u2026 with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 413 -> 418.8  \n Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  \n Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  \n Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8i3gjzj1v1b1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85f45cb78bb1d821682107696293d75addffaa43\n\nFutures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in\u2026 DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. \n\nIf we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). \n\nHowever, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baah8wek1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ad7f1bed271fc0ccc759cf47cd131db00f55f13\n\nSame story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. \n\nIf this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4055 -> 4208  \n Demand- 4128 -> 4075  \n Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   \n Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e0td00l1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb3e112d1b7c7d461bb36df8a515ce6f4ce7c98\n\nQQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY\u2026 QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. \n\nThe daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. \n\nHowever, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk3faoel1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c668e1bcc92d6f4bedd9ecc35986f1df6a5c257\n\nOne reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in\u2026 \n\nIf the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY\u2026\n\nThe next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqfco2tl1v1b1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=210f41cb75f825b2aee9bc8f65387188f8a65045\n\nHonestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point\u2026 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren\u2019t paying out very well\u2026 I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. \n\nStill working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading.",

The only possible positive I can glean from this scenario is that some of the loans in that portfolio were suffering high unrealized losses from interest rate hikes, but that doesn't seem like the case. One argument I keep seeing for the positive is that \"this helps keep them afloat longer\", but I find that not compelling at all to buy their shares. Now, they were said to have had 15 billion in liquidity (if I am remembering correctly) after the announcement of the \\~10% deposit loss in the first quarter which far exceeded the uninsured deposits. So the rush to sell of assets like this only points to further deposit flight in my opinion. The other scenario is that the 11 bil in short term borrowings has an unsustainable interest cost. A combination of these two problems is probably the most likely. Even if they put all of the proceeds from the sale of the real estate portfolio to their short term obligations, it still leaves a huge chunk of high-rate short term debt that seems untenable given the state of their deposits. So why did the market view this as a good sign? Were they just realizing they have a little more time to squeeze some more money out of the business or has PacWest's position fundamentally changed for the better?",

Started investing 18 months ago with 20k, bought in high lost down to 12k. Started playing options down to 8.5k perfected my strategy now 8k to 40k in 6 weeks. And if I actually followed my own damn advice and stuck to just my strategy I would be at 160k.  You have to be patient. Find what works and stick to it and don\u2019t chase action that doesn\u2019t fit your proven strategy. Mine is simple, doesn\u2019t even involve reading graphs, it hedges risk, and maximizes reward. Don\u2019t pay 2k to some ahole saying he will show you his strategy, if it truly worked they would have money to where your 2k didn\u2019t mean shit. It\u2019s very hard to beat the computers but there is a way. Without going into too much detail my strategy focuses on specific stock price points, terms, and volatility, earnings,that\u2019s it (but it is so specific only one or two positions each week line up). So when the chance lines up I take it. sometimes no trades for a week, maybe 3 trades on a great week. But the key is not to get on a high when one hits and go chasing, like I said if I didn\u2019t do that I would have 4x what I have now. But the key is to find what works, stick to it no matter what, have your stop losses in place (35 percent works for me, less and I miss opportunity, and hedging usually makes that 35 percent up and some). Just don\u2019t gamble, you will lose. But if you ever see me trying to sell you my formula run, if everyone adopted it the market would adjust, I don\u2019t expect it to last forever but hopefully I can adopt with it.

Being a student of history, or at least the history I am aware of, I can point to 4 times the US has defaulted.\n\nNow, before you get your underwear in a bundle, a default is when the issuer doesn't pay the debt/bond holder. I know people like to play fun with words but that's what it is, period.\n\nHere are the Greatest hits of the United States Default tour of 1862 to ????.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 1862 - US sold Demand Notes to fund the Civil War. Government printed paper money ie \"Greenbacks.\" and they devalued vs gold. Default #1.\n2. 1933 - US issued Gold Bonds which could be redeemed for gold coin. Until the Govt decided instead to \"pay back\" the gold bonds in paper currency. Default #2\n3. 1968 - US refused to honor the terms of Silver Certificate Paper dollars which stated that they could be redeemed for actual silver dollars. Adding insult to injury, the Govt voted in 1965 that Silver Dollars no longer had to be Silver. Default #3 and Screwjob #2034\n4. 1971 - Dollars held by foreign governments were supposed to be able to be redeemed for gold, under the Bretton Woods agreement, the agreement that forced the world onto the dollar. Govt said nope, and the world has never been the same. Btw, the dollars for gold was the FOUNDATION of the Bretton Woods agreement.\n\nSo, the US government has defaulted FOUR times.\n\nInterestingly, #2 went to the Supreme Court where the power of the US Government to default was upheld.\n\n\\#4 great quote: Then Treasurt Secty said in response: \"The dollar is our currency but its your (foreign nations) problem.\"\n\nAnd the trend of the US saying F U to other nations, began. Freaking Nixon.\n\nLook, the world and US citizens have already experienced the US govmt sayin nah, we ain't paying. And yet, the US marches on.\n\nAgain, to me one of the greatest risks for the country financially and geopolitically is the overt move by nations to move OFF the dollar. If I was them, I would want to do the same thing. The dollar is the single greatest weapon that the US has.\n\nFinally, I reiterate that all of this drama is BS. Seriously, This would not be the first time the US defaulted. Nor the first time the US was downgraded.\n\nI like my SPY calls, my QQQ calls, and my VIX calls.",

What will be perfect is if it continues through this Friday so the \"news\" can chirp about the end of the world the entire holiday weekend. Watch how fast those idiots in Wash get it done next week.\n\nIts so transparent. And Bc of that, I am looking to close my shorter dated VIX calls next week. I was commenting to one of members that the fact that my longer dated VIX calls are moving more tells me what the market expects past the inevitable debt ceiling deal - more Vol.\n\nIn the meantime, I am happy to do my job for the Bears and buy my SPY and QQQ calls at the high. will be adding more to those Friday also.\n\nThere will be a rally, temporary of course, when the debt deal gets done.\n\nIf you own short duration VIX calls, and you know who you are, I would be closing some of them over the next couple of days.

In short, he's not a fan of low prices.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the more he cuts production, the less enthusiastic his OPEC colleagues become, which in turn increases the likelihood that they will ramp up production, thus putting downward pressure on prices.\n\nNonetheless, his speeches do have a short-term effect - **prices are rising today**.\n\nStill, I wouldn't rule out a reduction in production following the OPEC+ meeting. This could be a group decision, or it could be a unilateral Saudi initiative.\n\nHowever, the impact **won't be as dramatic as it was in April**, and it **will also fade without\u00a0demand**\u00a0support.",

        "selftext": "# Deadline Duel: Yellen's Clock Ticks as Debt Ceiling Talks Trudge On\n\nUS stock markets experienced a dip, and short-term Treasury bills extended their losses as the negotiation process to increase the US debt ceiling hit a wall.\n\nNegotiations resumed on Tuesday, but the pace of progress was sluggish. The urgency asserted by Treasury Secretary Yellen's deadline for looming debt payments was challenged by several House Republicans.\n\nAs the window of opportunity for a political resolution narrows, investors are seeking higher premiums for holding US debt, particularly those securities at the highest risk of default. For instance, the securities yields due to maturity on June 8 exceed 5.7%, while those maturing on May 30 hover around 2%.\n\nFollowing their meeting on Monday, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characterized the discussions as fruitful. Nonetheless, consensus on the debt ceiling remains out of reach. McCarthy has urged Republicans to stay unified in their demands to forestall a potential US default.\n\n[TP 4 Achieved: SPY's 15-Minute Dance with Destiny](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13mryz0/spy_technical_analysis_for_monday_may_22_2022/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz8tgb5eao1b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e8853e3555952ff488f44bb1bbc58570e05bc70\n\n**SPY Wipes Out Equal Lows and Enters a Major Pullback Zone**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dn1t4lvfao1b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1db2eaddf69d17b031ad8b0872f8190035dd175d\n\n# Unraveling the FOMC Minutes: What to Expect from Tomorrow's Release\n\nTomorrow, May 24th, we will witness important economic events that could influence the financial markets.\n\nFirstly, at 12:40 pm ET, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to deliver a speech. Market participants closely watch Governor Waller's words as they often provide insights into the Federal Reserve's thinking on monetary policy and the health of the economy.\n\nFollowing this, at 2:00 pm ET, we'll have the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held in May. The minutes are a detailed record of the committee's policy-setting meeting, and they provide an in-depth description of the economic and financial conditions that influenced their vote on where to set interest rates. The FOMC minutes also offer insights into the Fed's view on economic growth, inflation, and other factors affecting the U.S. economy.\n\n# FOMC Minutes \u2013 What to Expect\n\nThe Federal Reserve will release the minutes from the May FOMC meeting tomorrow.

For instance, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently backed two more hikes in 2023, and the New York Fed's John Williams suggested that the natural level of interest rates could be higher than before the pandemic. In contrast, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari appeared more dovish, indicating openness to a rate pause on June\u200b[**16**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)**,**\u200b\u200b[**17**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).\n\nFinally, some assets exposed to rate expectations and growth outlook will likely experience volatility due to the FOMC minutes.

The meeting was characterized as \"productive\" and \"professional\" by McCarthy, but no deal was reached by the end of the day. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reaffirmed the June 1 date as the earliest the U.S. could be at serious risk of debt default. This issue was one of the key topics during Biden and McCarthy's meeting.\n\nA main sticking point in the talks remains the mandatory spending caps. McCarthy said he and his team would \"come back together and work through the night\" on a compromise deal. He and Biden know the impending deadline and intend to communicate daily until a resolution is found.\n\nBiden emphasized the need for a deal that can be \"sold to both sides\" of a closely divided Congress. McCarthy shared this sentiment, expressing cautious optimism that they can find common ground to strengthen the economy, address the debt, and get the government moving again to curb inflation and reduce dependency on China.\n\nMcCarthy also noted that the reality of the legislative process was starting to impact his decision-making. He stressed the importance of finalizing a deal this week to allow it to pass in the House and then move to the Senate to meet the June 1 deadline. He also stated his willingness to keep the House in session as long as necessary to pass a bill.\n\nThere seems to be a sense of urgency and concern among the negotiators. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had characterized a potential debt default in early June as \"highly likely,\" a shift from the previous week when it was described as merely \"likely.\" McCarthy has also expressed a belief that June 1 is a firm deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Representative Tom Graves of Georgia, who has been serving as a Republican point man on the ongoing negotiations, indicated that both sides are inching closer toward a consensus. Graves noted some areas where they are \"very close\" to the agreement, though he was reluctant to elaborate on specifics.\n\nGraves said, \"There's more that unites us than divides us,\" which offers hope for a bipartisan agreement. A glimmer of this hope could also be seen in the White House's statement asserting their belief in the existence of space for a bipartisan agreement.\n\nMost of the bipartisan talks have been dedicated to preserving the vaccine program. As The New York Times reported, officials from both sides are making efforts to ensure that the program continues receiving funding amidst the debt talks. The importance of this measure cannot be understated, especially considering the global implications of a potential disruption in the American vaccine program.\n\nOn the other hand, US GOP Representative Patrick McHenry has pointed out that the \"top line disagreement\" is still on spending\u2014the spending caps - whether mandatory or discretionary - remain contentious between the two parties.\n\nWhile some might view the discussions as a deadlock, others see it as a significant part of reaching a mutually agreeable solution. The American public and the world are closely watching as this political drama unfolds. Despite the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved, many remain hopeful that a consensus will be reached soon, averting a potential debt default.\n\nThe gravity of the situation is apparent. If a resolution isn't reached, the ripple effect of the United States defaulting on its debt could have far-reaching implications not just for the U.S. but for the global economy. It is hoped that the spirit of bipartisan cooperation will shine through these discussions and lead to a resolution to sustain the country's economic stability and continue supporting crucial programs like the vaccine initiative.\n\nThe clock is ticking, and the pressure is mounting.\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gl817i4mao1b1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9d42f233fbbbd90d4b9d5efd0c26115c3da18a8\n\nTomorrow's SPY analysis shows mixed sentiments. The daily chart looks bullish, and we're eyeing buying opportunities around 411.93-410.65. On the 1-hour chart, we're neutral to bearish but watchful for a bounce around the same block. The 15-minute chart remains bearish unless we see a structure change at 415.07 or bounce off the 411.93-410.65 order block.

LOW, AZO, BJ's, and DKS all fell short on sales. This was expected for LOW but surprising for AZO, considering the rising average age of used cars in the US. When looking at these earnings results as well as those of HD, TGT, WMT, and FL, it becomes apparent that consumer spending is softening. Consumers are reducing discretionary spending and opting for lower-priced alternatives. Currently, corporate margins remain intact or are even expanding, but this trend may change if demand continues to decline.\n\nJPM: \"Profit margins currently stand at 11.8%, a level of profitability that had only been eclipsed once in the pre-pandemic period.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r13qli5mn1b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a53414b60eed0e55252bcfd433b2b7b1c39f3df7\n\nThis chart very directly showed how Fed saved the regional and small banks.

This now makes this 418.78 to 419.5 a major supply and resistance area. In doing this we have no retraced all the way back down to take out 416.75, 415.58 and 413.91\u2026 we did fall just shy of touching 413.05 supply just under the daily 20ema though. \n\nTaking out the daily 8ema is a bearish omen for the markets, however, bouncing off the 20ema like we did today is bullish in nature. This should be seen as a support bounce rather than a bigger sell off for now. \n\nHowever, IF we continue to leg down tomorrow and close a candle under 413.05 supply which is the daily 20ema then I actually might be more apt for a that we see a retrace back to 410.2 demand (Support) before we bounce. This might be an example of being a day early for the bounce. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4anbi8ly7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3c4ca0c83f33def5b21cab77bf7dc98aecc1d49\n\nBears took us all the way down through the daily 8ema and bounced us right off that red support line at 413.7. As of now that should still be considered support until proven other wise. \n\nSupport for tomorrow of that line will be 414.6 meaning bulls need a small gap up overnight in order to reconfirm and hold that support with hopes of a push up to the 417/418 area. \n\nNow if this is the next leg down what bears need to do is break through 414.6 support and most importantly break under the daily 20ema and close a candle below it\u2026 If you remember we traded in that 410.2 to 413.9 range for almost 3 weeks before we finally broke out to 420\u2026 this actually is a back test of that support of that range. This is the bulls attempt to turn previous resistance into support.\n\nFailing to do that would result in a retrace back to the 410 range. To really sell this market off bears need a closure under 410.2. That 410.2 level is our daily demand so that likely would be a major support bounce area for bulls. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 413 -> 418.8  \n Demand- 410.2  \n Support- 414.1 -> 412.3 -> 410.2  \n Resistance- 417.1 -> 418.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/heeklg2z7n1b1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d9872058e6624a8801b3b223d9049d6d392cbe5b\n\nNearly identical movement from futes today setting a new supply at 4208. In doing this we would have expected the move down to the 4149/4143 supply area. We did come down and perfectly bounced off 4153. As of right now that is major support to watch. \n\nThere is a chance overnight bears get this to 4149 to take out that supply but from here I expect a bounce off the daily 20ema. \n\nIf bears continue their sell off though the biggest support will come at the 4127 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjx729hz7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1cffa25f6e8628f010c2a814faf90b2858b6f3b5\n\nFutures did not quite breakdown and touch that red support line that SPY did today. However, Futures did come down and perfectly back test and bounce off 4153 support form the previous 4122 to 4153 channel. \n\nWe also are setting up to close exactly on the daily 20ema which would favor a possible double bottom support bounce and move back up. \n\nThe most probable play out here is a double bottom off 4158 that leads to a move back up to the 4172 to 4188 area. \n\nHowever, if bears manage to break this down further then support is at 4125 if we see back to back selling off happen. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4149 -> 4208  \n Demand- 4128 -> 4198  \n Support- 4158 -> 4125  \n Resistance- 4172 -> 4189\n\n**QQQ Supply and Demand DAILY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de7nq8zz7n1b1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e02e2c989bddab9be571556c6bab5d1e126b1a2\n\nI said last week I was looking for a possible sell off back to the daily 8ema being that QQQ is in extreme bull momentum in order to find an opportunity for a long entry. We are looking to be getting just that. \n\nThe daily officially turned 337.63 into a new supply\u2026 In doing so we come down and take out 337.29 and 333.11 supply. Now we do have another supply left down below at 326.82 but that is at the daily 20ema. That would be a larger sell off and with us being in extreme bull momentum I would be very surprised to see that move happen (not that it cant happen though). \n\nI will be looking for the bulls to bounce off the daily 8ema tomorrow and look for a run back to the 336.37 demand area. \n\nHowever, If this sell off continues then are most probable sell off target is that 326.82 supply which is also the daily 20ema. 325-326 is a pretty strong demand (Support) area that we would need more momentum to break through. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 324.99\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elwg2ng08n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=061adc87a00ef65fe92175bac8500ded2416b1ea\n\nThe VIX actually had a really nice breakout today and after bouncing off the 16 support area 3 days ago now this is now retesting critical resistance at 18.86. IF the bears (spy) can close the VIX over 18.86 and target 20.08 then I would believe in a bigger sell off on SPY happening. However, this is a probable rejection area for the VIX. Even if the VIX gets to 20.08 we still honestly are more likely to reject then we are to sell off\u2026\n\nThere just isn\u2019t any real momentum to the downside and even watching the intraday movement today the dip continues to get bought. \n\nWith no debt ceiling talks till tomorrow minimum and FOMC minutes at 2pm we likely are to return to a slightly bullish narrative. There is a chance the market could bearishly take what JPOW had to say at FOMC but historically they usually receive FOMC minutes well not poorly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndrrkwv08n1b1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=645e181783cd4ea79c9da996e86b4d28eb730222\n\nYellen is scheduled to talk at 1005am though so that could be a true wildcard. Tomorrow with Yellen and FOMC minutes is likely to be very volatile. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5il29mb18n1b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff618dd4b661038a7a511587b6cd5c29a638440a\n\nI really struggled this morning in that very tight range and chop\u2026 just seemed like premiums weren\u2019t paying out for the move that was happening. However, was really able to capitalize on that mid day sell off and overall had a great day trading. Intraday secured another weeks of profit goal. Currently even if my QQQ and SPY Call lottos go to zero tomorrow I have officially secured 2.5x my weekly profit goal\u2026 if they don\u2019t go to zero tomorrow then im sitting at 3x weekly profits goal. \n\nCurrently assuming my week ends profitable this will be my 8th green week in a row\u2026 that makes it tied for my second longest win streak in a row\u2026 my longest current win streak (since I have started documenting the way I do now\u2026 remember I used to work full time as a nurse and just traded in my off times) is 10 weeks in a row of green. \n\nJust for transparency my longest red streak is 4 weeks in a row.",

        "title": "Gogoro $GGR: Expanding Horizons - International Growth and New Product Offerings",
        "selftext": "Gogoro is the leading battery swapping company for two-wheelers in the APAC market. Currently, they have approximately 540,000 subscribers, over 12,400 installed racks, and 1.1 million batteries in circulation. Their annual revenue amounts to around $400 million, primarily generated in Taiwan.\n\nAbout a year ago, Gogoro became a public company through a SPAC listing. However, like many SPACs, Gogoro's share price has declined significantly from $10 to $3 (with a peak value of $17.59 right after listing). The trading volume per day is minimal.\n\nThe drop in valuation can be attributed, in part, to the challenges faced during Gogoro's initial expansion into China. Currently, the China network is being maintained by partner companies like Yadea, which have invested their own funds into the network. For Gogoro, this situation is relatively neutral as there are limited expectations for expansion, but also minimal costs associated with the existing network (less than 300 swapping stations).\n\nHaving learned from their experiences, Gogoro has shifted its strategy to focus on the B2B market in other international markets. The aim is to establish a strong network with B2B partners (Zypp Electric,  Globe Group, Ayala Corporation, Foodpanda, Gojek etc.) who can benefit from battery swapping compared to traditional charging. Following that, Gogoro plans to launch their offerings to B2C customers.\n\nBased on close observation of the company, here is an overview of what can be expected in the short to mid-term:\n\n**Introduction of new scooter models for international markets (Philippines, India, South Korea, etc.):**\n\n* Expected timeline: mid-2023\n* Manufactured in India\n* Attractive price range: $1000-$1500 USD\n* Sales to existing B2B partners as well as B2C customers (sales starting this year)\n* Potential for export to Taiwan\n\n**Release of new scooter models for the Taiwanese market:**\n\n* Expected timeline: second half of 2023\n* Focus on low-power category models, which are gaining popularity\n\n**Expansion of Gogoro's Battery Swapping Network internationally:**\n\n* Philippines: B2C network launch in Q4 of this year\n* South Korea: Network expansion from 70 stations (used by B2B partners) to 200 by the end of this year (potential introduction of B2C scooters to early adopters)\n* India: B2B network expansion in major cities this year\n* Indonesia and Singapore: Planned expansions to follow\n* China expansion will be put on hold, with a refocused emphasis on other countries\n\n**Development of PBGN models by partners like Hero Motocorp:**\n\n* Timetable: Models will be announced when the international battery swapping network is sufficiently established for B2C launch.\n\nSuccess in international network expansions, coupled with positive reception of new scooter models, is expected to bring favorable outcomes. Scooter sales are anticipated to increase this year, generating international revenue. However, this year primarily focuses on building a solid foundation with B2B partners to facilitate accelerated expansion into the B2C market starting in 2024 and beyond.\n\nGogoro has given the following estimates for the market potential:Philippines = Taiwan market x 3India = Taiwan market x 100No estimate for Indonesia + South Korea + Singapore + Japan + Israel etc.\n\nGogoro's goal for 2023 is to generate 5-10% of their total revenue from international markets, which amounts to approximately $20-45 million based on their projected revenue of $400-450 million. No estimate yet from 2024 onwards.\n\nWhat do you think? Will Gogoro succeed in their ambitious international expansion plans, or will they face significant challenges along the way? As investors, is it wise to take a risk and buy the stock now, or should we wait until we see concrete numbers in the balance sheet? Let's delve into the possibilities and examine the factors that may shape Gogoro's future.",

But its government's continued focus on near-term economic growth over long-term sustainability will increase the risk of the country entering such a crisis in 2023. Turkey's economy grew quickly in 2022 as the country emerged strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic and absorbed the initial shocks of Russia's war in Ukraine. But this brought with it soaring inflation (which hit an eyewatering 84% last month) and a deeply weakened currency (which has lost almost one-third of its value year-on-year). Unlike other countries that have responded to the post-COVID-19 and Ukraine-related surge in global commodity prices by tightening their monetary policies, Turkey has pursued monetary easing -- resorting to orthodox and unorthodox measures to slow the lira's depreciation, which has increased the financial burden of companies with foreign-currency debt.

However, since I have equal disdain for both, I DO count Obama's NON-Affordable Care Act as a HUGE increase in debt.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nLet's take a look at past debt ceiling dramas - I have taken each timeframe and looked at the high of the market and then the lowest point DURING the debate, not the month prior:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Timeframe|SP 500 performance (HIGH to LOW)|\n|:-|:-|\n|July 2011 - August 2011|\\-17%|\n|Sept 19, 2013 - October 9, 2013|\\-4.8%|\n|Sept 2 2021 - October 4 2021|\\-5.8%|\n\n2011 was sort of an outlier since Europe was in shambles then so that added fuel to the fire.\n\nNow lets look at the month FOLLOWING a deal; First the performance one month later and then the LOW to HIGH during the 30 months after; 2021 was a mess because of temporary measures etc, though,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Timeframe|One month after - LOW to +30d CLOSE|One month after LOW to HIGH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Aug 9, 2011 - Sept 9, 2011|\\+4.8%|\\+11.7%|\n|October 9 2013 - Nov 8 2913|\\+7.5%|\\+7.8%|\n|October 4 - November 5, 2021|\\+9.4%|\\+9.4%|\n\nSo, since I believe the debt ceiling will get \"fixed\" what matters after its done is more important than during.\n\nObviously I am LONG the VIX, but as I have shared, I have many other reasons why I am positioned as such.\n\nHowever, being the betting man I am, although this is a very small sample but it is correlative because it is during more \"modern\" market structure, I will be adding SPY and QQQ - maybe even 2xETFs Calls of each.\n\nYes, you read that right, I remain LONG VIX (Aug-Oct) and will get LONG SPY (AUG) and LONG QQQ (AUG).\n\nBefore you inundate me with how can I be long SPY and VIX?  Bc I believe the debt deal will get done sooner and I still believe the house of cards, or part of the house, will come crumbling down by AUG-OCT and I am prepared to roll.  I remain heavily long VIX but am flat to slightly up = thankyou long dated options.\n\nThank you..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8p4nyrp08i1b1.gif",

        "selftext": "The Federal Reserve's 2023 report titled \"[Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202305.pdf)\" provides a snapshot of American households' financial conditions. My key takeaway from this in-depth examination is a worrisome trend of declining financial well-being coupled with rising anxieties over future financial security, particularly regarding retirement savings. Despite these uncertainties, the report depicts a robust labor market and pervasive banking and credit services access. However, issues persist in areas such as housing affordability and the perceived value of education against its cost. The data further underscores the significant influence of broader economic conditions, such as inflation and market volatility, on households' financial status. Overall, the insights gathered from this report offer a critical perspective on the challenges and realities shaping America's economic landscape.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\n1. **The Decline in Financial Well-being**: The report indicates a decline in people's financial well-being over the previous year. Self-reported financial well-being fell sharply and was among the lowest observed since 2016. The share of adults who said that they spent less than their income in the month before the survey fell in 2022 from the prior year, while the share said that their credit card debt increased.\n2. **Concerns about Future Financial Security**: Among adults who were not retired, the survey showed a decline in the share who felt that their retirement savings plan was on track, suggesting that individuals had concerns about their future financial security.\n3. **Impact of Broader Economic Conditions**: The financial well-being declines across these measures indicate how families were affected by broader economic conditions in 2022, such as inflation and stock market declines.\n4. **Labor Market Strength**: Despite concerns about rising prices and their ability to build savings, the survey results indicated continued labor market strength in late 2022. The share of adults who voluntarily quit asked for a raise or received a raise increased slightly over the prior year's survey, reflecting the strong labor market.\n5. **Banking and Credit**: Access to financial services from banks and credit unions remained high. In 2022, 94 percent of adults had a bank account, although notable gaps remain by income, age, race, ethnicity, and disability status.\n6. **Housing and Rent**: Nearly two-thirds of renters said their inability to afford a down payment to buy a home was why they rent\u2014seventeen percent of renters needed to catch up on their rent at some point in the prior year.\n7. **Education and Student Loans**: More than two-thirds of adults with a bachelor's degree or more said the financial benefits of their education exceeded the cost. However, a lower 3 in 10 of those who started but still needed to complete at least an associate degree shared this view.\n8. **Retirement and Investments**: Progress toward retirement savings goals declined in 2022. Thirty-one percent of non-retirees thought their retirement savings plan was on track, down from 40 percent in 2021.",

Maybe you'll find $10, maybe you'll find $1.05, maybe nothing, but the times you find a $100 bill should offset that.\n\nRecent studies show that Americans have a couch for about six years and they usually contain at least $1.55 in change at any given time. That is good odds. How many couches are in the US right now? Jaime, pull that up. There's 123.6 million housholds in the US. That means we're missing out on at least a 1.9 million dollar budget shortfall on American couches.\n\nThen we can expand this to include money under car seats, money in center consoles, money on unspent gift cards. The IRS could include gift card searches in thier searches and if they find a gift card close to expiration you can deduct it as a tax credit and they can use it to pay government workers, that way they get meals and they don't get as hurt by inflation at the grocer.\n\nThink of all the gas stations where you don't pick up the penny on the ground when you walk by. There are at least 145,000 gas stations in the US, if each one has an uncollected penny that's at least $1450! That's not including the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny dishes.

Until we put in a new supply though (resistance) we should consider the upside as the favor. IF and when we put in a new supply then we will start to look for the slew of supplies from 413.05 to 416.75 to be taken out. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0buary10g1b1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07889364be0bea690eb4174b9ff6d98187354d71\n\nThe bulls for a second saw 420 again before it was absolutely blasted down EOD. That 419.5 continues to be a strong resistance here and that is what we will look for tomorrow. We did come down and double bottom off 418.6, however, this doji we really could go either way. For now with SPY weekly in extreme bull momentum and the daily attempting to break back into that momentum the daily 8ema should be considered strong support and should be considered a take profit for shorts and a potential entry for a long. \n\nSpy Daily Levels  \n Supply- 419.5 -> 416.8 -> 415.6  \n Demand- 410.2  \n Support- 418.6 -> 416.9 -> 414.8  \n Resistance- 420.2 -> 422.1 \n\n**ES FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmmbiud20g1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bebb7ad5e67408675569555baa73e81b3cc3e3e7\n\nNow futures actually shows a different story but in the end the results and expectations remains the same\u2026 on futures we actually established a new supply at 4216. In doing so we came back down and took out previous supply at 4191 today. However, the major difference here is that we established a new 4198 demand. In doing this the favoritism remains the upside much like SPY\u2026 however, the reasoning for why we expect upside differs. \n\nI will say that both SPY and Futes are nearing some very overbought territory and nearing a new DMI daily wave down. But like I said we are in extreme bull momentum so realistically daily 8ema should be considered support. \n\n**ES FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2c80bo530g1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21b9d81c6adec5dd29d5f12a1df125c1d32102fa\n\nLooking at futures daily here it actually looks a little more toppy then SPY does. That 4216 is becoming really stout resistance and for the 3rd day in a row bulls have failed to close over it. However, as you see we came down and bounced right off the daily 8ema support. \n\nI am bullish until we close the 8ema support. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4216 ->4311  \n Demand- 4198-> 4127  \n Support- 4188 -> 4172 -> 4153  \n Resistance- 4216 -> 4237\n\n**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND DAILY** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gx814en30g1b1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54cb5026abb009dc215dfa208af78ab843a83a2c\n\nNow I actually was watching this very closely EOD as I almost opened a short position with a target of 333. There was a moment EOD where it looked like we were going to get a really nice 337.3 rejection and resistance. This would then negated putting a new demand being put in\u2026 however, the bulls closed out a bullish engulfing daily candle and put in a new 336.37 demand. \n\nIn doing so and closing over 337.29 they open up the potential for a move back to that 347.11 supply. However, as you can see that yellow resistance line does have 3 touches and holds. 339.1 will be that key resistance for tomorrow at the yellow line. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 347.1 -> 337.3 -> 333.1  \n Demand- 336.4 -> 326\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37li2b440g1b1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=064c7162540bcf3ef8945e4f27ef31da2e5d16ab\n\nNow the VIX still has failed to break out and can not seem to hold that 17.97 resistance area once it touches it. However, we have now retaken that key 16.92 support area. This doji candle failed breakout would signal a drop on the VIX tomorrow and move up on SPY tomorrow. \n\nNow the weirdest thing about today? The fact that SPY, VIX , 10YR Yield and DXY all closed green\u2026 that is not something you see every day\u2026\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccy8a8i40g1b1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=547d9cbbb2a1e5dc2d905cfd9e2bfd9999bb6207\n\nI unfortunately woke up with a 101 degree fever this morning and have not been feeling the best all day today\u2026. However, I was able to play some absolutely banger wins today. I was blessed to be on the right side of that huge 10am wick down and was able to close almost right at the bottom. \n\nOverall for a Monday today was a great day and I closed out my day being almost 2x my weekly profits.

        "selftext": "I used to come on here all the time trying to talk some sense into you regards. This is the last time I'm going to try to help you monkeys save yourselves from yourselves. From here on out I'm just going to laugh at you fucking regards wreck your lives with greed. After this I'm going to drive out to $COST and buy a giant sack of Kosher salt so I can rub it deep inside your wounds when you present them. \n\n**1:You regards wouldn't know what good advice was if you read it**\n\nOne of the most common complaints I see right after one of you regards blows your rent money on 0 DTE call options in the middle of a bear setup or vice versa is, \"Why don't successful traders share their knowledge.\"   \nSuccessful traders do share their advice. Often, it comes for free. But you're too fucking stupid to recognize good trading advice when you see it. Before you get scammed by shysters selling you $1,000 systems and $20 Discord group subscriptions just to tell you bullshit like \"the trend is your friend\", I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in: Jesse, Warren, Soros and Bury, Mesiler from Real Money, Amrit Sall and Peter. \n\n1: George Soros - This motherfucker is so good at trading that Joe Rogan actually started spewing that antisemitic trope that Jews are trying to control the world on his podcast. I know you fucking monkeys can't read, but on the off chance one of you has two brain cells left after that Wendy's shift, give some guy a handy by the dumpster and take the bus to Barnes and Noble and pick up a copy of *The Alchemy of Finance* with your sex money. Soros just fucking gives away trading strategies in that book. \n\n2: Jesse Livermore - The OG. Read the book about him called \"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\". Livermore is the king of \"This has all happened before, this will all happen again.\" He describes how the strategies he used were used in the 1850's and then in his time in the early 1900's, and I'm finding that most of what he says still works. \n\n3: Warren Buffet - He literally explains all of his major trading decisions every god damn year in one of the biggest finance events of the year. \n\n4: Michael Burry - Genius levels of spectrum intelligence. This man has deleted more brilliant tweets than I have taken shits. \n\n5: Helene Meisler - Brillaint fucking chart technician. She is all over podcasts and Twitter including two episodes of Odd Lots. \n\nI know a lot of you are going to say, \"BUT I FOLLOW DEM WHY NO TENDIES!\"   \n\n\nYou're a fucking moron, that's why. \n\n**2: Trading On Fundamentals Works**\n\nJust keep your fucking eyes and ears open. Be observant. It can be as simple as tracking what you're paying in gas for your car.   \nBetter yet, listen to conference calls. Publicly traded companies have a mild legal obligation to tell you the truth, and can get in trouble for misleading investors. So, go listen to what they have to say. You know who doesn't have to tell you the truth? Anyone on CNB FUCKING C. \n\nOne of the best trades I made was because it was the month I I decided to start listening to earnings calls. During a call, [CVX outlined a baseline $75 oil price](https://www.chevron.com/investors/events-presentations). I watched oil prices and the moment I saw oil climb above $75 I knew oil companies were going to go gangbusters. \n\nListen to the conference calls. Listen to what the bankers care about. Also, get to know who the bankers are from and where they work. You'll start to be able to guess where big money is going to move next, and be able to watch out for signs of those shifts in the charts.   \nRemember, conference calls are a poker game. If you have any people reading skills, you'll do well. \n\n**3: Technical Analysis Works,**   \n\n\nBut you're shit at TA and so it won't work for you. But let me try to help you. Again, I know how hard this undertaking is, but I tend to run into, not away from difficult situations for the challenge. \n\nThe biggest critics of Technical Analysis accuse technicians of not being able to predict stock prices. A lot of people say things like \"Ahhh hhahahahahaha, squiggly lines don't work. Hahaha. Get rekt! \n\nYou don't draw the line and expect the price to do what the line says, fuckwit. You draw a line and use it to determine if the stock is doing what it is supposed to do. For example, I bought into $BABA a while back because if we were going to get a spike back to the 100's, the price probably wouldn't fall much below that purple line.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3eobjixuy91b1.jpg?width=673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18b4121d149c1b4510da0404a2b8e8105f142291\n\nIf BABA fell below the purple line and stayed there for a few trading sessions I would have killed the position. It didn't. I got the pop. I sold, and took money from /r/BABA. \n\nWhy Technical Analysis Works  \nTechnical analysis is nothing more than human psychology expressed as a graph of stock price over time. If we accept that humans are ultimately what moves a stock price, then we should see things like greed, fear, panic, and uncertainty. Each of these human emotions has a chart pattern associated with it. Stare at some charts. Learn what panic looks like, learn what greed looks like. I have included 3 charts, one for uncertainty, fear, and greed that explains how to spot both of those.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5x6qu7wy91b1.jpg?width=1883&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b9b2becb227c36c9e851f0f4c549fe31d344f7ba\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy4to2axy91b1.jpg?width=1917&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2824fb2b1fe588bb4e0e17aff36639a7effbf58\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiz1ti30z91b1.jpg?width=1897&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3d653a70c65263aba648a3fbfdfe3b0f18f0548\n\nOther Uses for TA  \n1: Determine if there is a gap between reality and stock prices. For example, on my oil trade in 2021 and 2022 I noticed there had not been a bull run in energy stocks despite a bull run in oil. I had a feeling oil stocks would eventually catch up with oil, so I bought some shares and leaps.  \n\n2: Reduce Risk - TA can help you find ideal entry and exit points. I know monkeys don't like planning, but using TA you can plan entries and exits in advance. I tend to enter trades at or near key resistance levels and set my stops just below those levels. \n\n3: Determine Market Sentiment  \nI use price and volume to determine market sentiment. One of the problems that plagues new traders is price not reflecting news. They are often bearish when they should be bullish and vice versa. I have included pictures of what uncertainty, greed, and panic look like in the market. When we're going Up volume is falling, when we're going down volume is rising. It's damn near as simple as that. Don't try to make it more complicated than that with Okonomiyaki Clouds or bullshit like that, at least not until you have the basics down. \n\nOften the news will be super bullish or super bearish and incredibly wrong. You regards especially are wrong and I've taken so many \"time to switch from bull to bear\" cues from you regards I almost feel like I owe you money. But the charts don't lie. News is bearish? Look for rising volume to confirm. News is bullish? Look for falling volume to confirm.   \nTell ya what, I'll be sporting. If you catch me by a Wedny's dumpster, I'll tip after the handy. Deal? And thanks for your help. \n\n4: Combine Technical and Fundamental Analysis\n\nI personally combine the two. If I could only use charts or fundamentals, I would choose charts. I don't think I'd be as good, but I think I'd be just fine. \n\n**5:** **For the Love of God, You Goddamned Monkeys Stop YOLO'ing Everything**\n\nOr Do, I don't give a shit anymore. \n\nOkay. I gave you all the basics. The rest is on you. I'm just coming back for the LOLZ from now on because you idiots keep downvoting me when I post correct information. That's fine. I'm sure plenty a zookeeper has been hit with flung feces. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6: You're not a serious person if you don't have a trading idol**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spyp6escz91b1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab741006fe833dfb37708dcbe5fb62aea3e2aa9c\n\nThe trader I look up to is George Soros. I fucking love him as a trader. He trades exactly the way I want to trade someday: with billions of dollars. My favorite quote of his is \"You call that a position?\" when he was dressing down Ray Dalio for not risking enough.   \n\n\nI have studied Soros, what he did, how he did it, why he did it. It's amazing. It's incredible It's beautiful.",

        "selftext": "  I'm back with an even more detailed look at my VIX trading strategy that led me to $375,000 in profits. Thanks to your insightful comments, I've further refined my strategy and uncovered additional patterns from my dataset, which spans 16 years of market data. Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the enhanced strategy!\n\n**The Data**\n\nAs a reminder, I analyzed 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data from 2005 to 2021. The dataset included:\n\n\u00b7 Daily VIX and SPX closing prices\n\n\u00b7 Gamma highs and lows\n\n\u00b7 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages\n\n\u00b7 Moon phases (full moon and new moon dates)\n\n**Key Insights and Revisions**\n\nWith your comments in mind, I revisited the dataset and discovered even more fascinating patterns that further strengthened my strategy:\n\n1. From 2005 to 2021, on average, the VIX increased by 3.57% during new moons and decreased by 2.81% during full moons. This trend persisted across various market conditions and reinforced my decision to use moon phases in my trading strategy. As [u/5JeepHardRock](https://www.reddit.com/u/5JeepHardRock/) pointed out, full moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, which helped me better time my trades.\n\n2. The inverse relationship between the VIX and SPX was particularly strong during significant market events. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX reached an all-time high of 80.86, while the SPX plummeted by more than 50%. This insight was crucial in helping me identify opportunities to short the SPX and buy VIX call options.\n\n3. In the 16-year dataset, there were 27 instances where the Gamma spread was above 85. In 22 of these instances (81.48%), the VIX experienced a decline within the next 3 to 5 trading days, providing a perfect setup for my Thunder Call spreads.\n\n4. Bullish markets saw an average VIX decline of 4.92% when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average. This pattern helped me time my Thunder Put trades to capitalize on potential market reversals.\n\n5. As [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/) mentioned, I didn't make any significant gains in 2021. This is because the VIX was essentially flat during that year. However, I consider it a win, as my strategy helped me avoid unnecessary trades and potential losses in a volatile market.\n\n**The Enhanced Strategy**\n\nWith the newfound insights and revisions, I've refined my initial strategy as follows:\n\n1. During new moons, I shorted the SPX and bought VIX call options.\n\n2. During full moons, I engaged in long puts on the VIX (Lightning Puts).\n\n3. If a full moon occurred and the Gamma spread was 85 or higher, I entered a Thunder Call spread.\n\n4. In bullish markets, I timed my Thunder Put trades to coincide with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.\n\n5. In periods of low VIX movement, such as 2021, I exercised patience and avoided unnecessary trades.\n\n**Further Opportunities**\n\n[u/Comicdn](https://www.reddit.com/u/Comicdn/) and [u/Affectionate\\_Fix8401](https://www.reddit.com/u/Affectionate_Fix8401/) suggested that I could also explore potential squeeze/pump plays alongside my complex options trading. This is an excellent idea that could potentially boost my profits even further. I plan to delve into this area and share my findings with you all soon.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe more data you have, the better equipped you are to make informed trading decisions. By analyzing 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data, I was able to create a robust strategy that led me to a $375,000 profit. Your comments and feedback have been invaluable in refining and enhancing my approach.\n\nRemember, investing is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. Be open to new ideas and strategies, and always strive to improve your understanding of the markets. Thank you all for your insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning from each other.\n\nGood luck, and happy trading!\n\nP.S. As for the Jugo ETF idea from [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/), who knows? Maybe one day, we can all collaborate to launch it together.\n\nEdit to the original post:\n\nUpdate: Some people have mentioned that they think I'm joking because of the funny names I've used for my strategies. Let me clarify my approach.\n\nTo keep things straight, I come up with memorable names for my findings and then use data science to validate my hypotheses. If a hypothesis fails, I set it aside in case I can use a portion of it within another strategy or as a precursor. I like to think of strategies as switches in a house. You need to have multiple switches, but if they're all on, you're being wasteful. If you only have one on, you can't see clearly. The goal is to have a few on for the room you're in, setting the right vibe.\n\nIn other words, each strategy is not always engaged. They all have their own on/off switches and dimmers, as well as a master kill switch and a full-house surge protector. This approach allows me to adapt and optimize my trading strategies based on current market conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o21jzo3q781b1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81c0255dfa5bb6af66e9139836aa5496d82075ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2khn4sdq781b1.jpg?width=391&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ddd2cfcc5c78b55750420838578451b10d25ecf4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7xm0dpq781b1.png?width=2148&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0668a5f2d24ac5e881dd66c4bbfc64139c3704e2",

Bank of America (BoA) card data indicated a larger decrease in travel spending compared to the previous month. However, April's core retail sales (excluding automobiles and gas) were higher than expected, driven by restaurant and online purchases. BAC credit and debit card data revealed that consumers have been trading down and spending more at value grocery stores to cope with inflation. Overall, consumers' financial health remains strong, but delinquency rates increased in Q1. The frequency of CEOs mentioning \"inflation\" during earnings calls reached a one-and-a-half-year low. Most Fed members who spoke this week had a hawkish stance, increasing the probability of a June interest rate hike to over 40% on Thursday. However, the market was calmed by remarks from JP, bringing the probability back down to 20% on Friday.\n\n[Inflation data summary this week](https://preview.redd.it/qcm1kk49831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57c7b65c74233f9dc02ab9865d770e289fcb25fa)\n\n[Summary from previous weeks](https://preview.redd.it/keifgd6c831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54fb44271bcfdbc5355e5ff487e157c85f0b255a)\n\n[Personal spending still on a downward trend](https://preview.redd.it/4539t3m7831b1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6caa8ebe8590a086b002d28c1bfebbd80eba86e)\n\n**The Leading Economic Index (LEI) reached a new low, but industrial output rebounded more than expected. The GDPNow model predicts a 2.9% growth for Q2, indicating no sign of a recession yet.** Economic data this week showed mixed results. Although the LEI dropped in April, the decline was smaller than the previous month. The overall the indicator still pointed to a mild recession in Q3. The housing market, including homebuilder sentiment, starts, permits, sales, and prices, appears to have stabilized, which is a positive sign for the economy. US industrial production unexpectedly increased in April, particularly in auto production, which is a strong economic signal and could potentially address the issue of record low inventory nationwide. The US job market remains healthy and tight, with jobless claims lower than estimated last week. Global economic growth remains sluggish, with both EU and Chinese industrial output falling short of expectations.\n\n[Summary of economic data](https://preview.redd.it/royqlirv831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6bde1af4d2eda069a3be335e8a5a56ce29b34fbc)\n\nUS business and markets: The number of companies mentioning \"recession\" during earnings calls has reached a one-year low. In Q1 earnings calls, 107 companies cited \"recession,\" which is higher than the 5-year average of 77 and the 10-year average of 59. However, this number has declined for the third consecutive quarter after peaking in Q2 2022. In terms of sectors, information technology and healthcare seem to be the least concerned about a recession. There has been increased discussion about the debt ceiling, but the stock market has remained relatively stable without much volatility. The bond market experienced a significant sell-off, leading to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond reaching its highest level in over two months. This sell-off is likely due to hawkish talks from the Federal Reserve rather than concerns about the debt ceiling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pw72n6u5931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3833a8273c6f81798452b10f3c5408656dac2fb3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gi1sfi6931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b01e86f8be55ffa8a9d5d2c900596b4506e14ad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yci17vz6931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=418503c832af6f1eb57fe768983f408f5ac23cfc\n\nThe S&P 500 posted a 1.6% gain for the week, breaking free from a narrow range it had been stuck in since April. Mega-cap stocks once again outperformed their value counterparts, maintaining growth equity's strong performance this year. Earnings reports from major consumer-related companies painted a gloomy picture of consumer spending. Both Home Depot and Target provided full-year guidance below market expectations. However, Walmart provided a silver lining as it benefited from consumer trade-downs. The company cited gains in groceries and increased store visits from budget-conscious affluent consumers. During economic downturns, weak household consumption often stems from consumers reducing their debt levels. However, debt payment levels today remain well below historical averages, suggesting that while household consumption may slow, a significant contraction is not expected in the near future. As consumer spending is 70% of GDP, a deep recession is still unlikely.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t39zywn931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b38395161a75bd5d9ddae1d1f4eb98e0a27a9b25\n\n# My positions and predictions\n\n**US Equity Valuation**\n\nAnalysts\u2019 estimations:\n\n2023 Full Year EPS: $220 (down from $221 last week)\n\nNTM EPS: $230 (unchanged from last week)\n\n2024 Full Year EPS: $246 (down from $247 last week)\n\nCurrent forward PE: 18.3 (up from 18.0 last week), lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqdwnvhs931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f24d2aebb54e0f181370ea490e3b532fd241a4e5\n\nMy investment thesis has not changed.

When looking at lumber companies, some have mentioned a decline in single-family starts as a reason for their decline in revenue. Companies like Boise Cascade have reported revenue declines of 34% YOY and companies like Weyerhauser reported a 71% decline in revenue YOY.\n\n4) The Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIn this spreadsheet, the first tab shows historic quarterly revenue and the %yoy increase or decrease. Here you can see that there are really only a few years where Home Depot reported a negative quarter YOY decline\n\nTo the right, I have TTM and FEPS. TTM stands for trailing 12 months which is the 4 most recent quarters of EPS added together. FEPS stands for Forward EPS which I was able to calculate using their 2023 EPS guidance. For this calculation, I multiplied 2022 EPS by 90% to represent the mid between the 7% to 13% decline in EPS for this year.\n\nHistoric EPS on the conservative side tends to be around 15 to 17 as found on MACRO Trends. Currently, we are around 17 PE using TTM EPS. Using FEPS, we are around 19 PE. Personally, I think we're a bit overpriced. Below that, I show the current dividend yield. In the Next tab over, I show their dividend history and how their dividend has grown over time. Home Depot is really well known for its amazing dividend growth. \n\nI forecast different price points based on either PE multiples or technical supports and show what dividend yield will look like currently, 1 year out, and 2 years out assuming a 10% yearly dividend growth forecast.\n\nHere are the technicals for HD to go along with the spreadsheet: [https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png)\n\nThe blue line is an anchored VWAP from the all-time highs.\n\nIf you are interested in Home Depot stock, this may help you decide where fair value is and what your future dividend gains may look like. Also keep in mind if we see another housing boom with interest rate cuts, companies like Home Depot are likely to benefit yet again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you all enjoyed\\~",

So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made.

Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals.

Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.\n\n# Methodology\n\nWithin this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:\n\n* Discounted Free Cash Flow\n* Graham's Fair Value\n* Graham's Number\n\n# Industry Outlook\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector\u2019s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.\n\nMoreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.\n\nDespite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:\n\n* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.\n* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.\n* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.\n* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.\n\nIn both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.\n\nIt's important to note that \"chips\" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.\n\nThe semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.\n\n# Main Competitors\n\nIntel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:\n\n* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.\n* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.\n* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.\n* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.\n* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10pempxfc21b1.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8128fd80db9458956d93b1a7a1bf685ba353bd2b\n\n# Fair Value\n\nTaking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.\n\n**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**\n\nPlugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36\n\n**Graham's Fair Value**\n\nThe Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.\n\n**Graham's Number**\n\nBy using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z89aozbmc21b1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4219c3566d5909bf458a7a7fe77def9c476470cd\n\n# Conclusions\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nWe shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.\n\n**The Future**\n\nIntel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a \"systems foundry\" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nINTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6km5yhfjb21b1.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0114911218e04de0ac8dc4939c300bacade8031b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpfxxxykb21b1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbd8d92396373f2cadbff34f409cca2e27518d17\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nx7ycqob21b1.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a43affd158971e8097e834aad328619e44c508a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyb1y5erb21b1.png?width=2714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=984e615a25bbdf79b465153d0b2eec3a8b9ee099",

I am aware that it would massively impact the worlds trust with them and could potentially limit future loans, but why does it impact the country initially? (The article said that they lost 50% of manufacturing jobs and inflation went rampant.) What happens if the country just says, \"Na, I'm not acknowledging that debt anymore\"? Short of all out war, how would they even enforce a debt in that case? Is it even possible without imposing sanctions and further destabilizing the global market?\n\nWhile I understand this may not be the ideal location to gain understanding, there is no way to isolate what happens to countries in the geopolitical sphere from the markets.

        "selftext": "# Powell's Pause, Yellen's Warning: A Double Whammy for the Market?\n\n**May 19th Recap**\n\nMarket participants scaled back their expectations for a June rate increase by the Federal Reserve to a mere 25%, following indications from Jerome Powell of a potential hiatus. The equity markets experienced a downturn, primarily driven by a slump in banking shares and mounting anxiety over the inability of US legislators to establish a consensus to avert a default.\n\nThe S&P 500 halted its two-day streak of gains, unable to sustain above the critical threshold of 4,200, following comments from a Republican representative suggesting a temporary halt in bipartisan discussions in Washington. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy remained silent when questioned about upcoming debt-ceiling discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, valued at $3.2 billion, saw a near 2% decline. This drop came in response to news that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had informed leaders of prominent financial institutions that further consolidations might be necessary.\n\n# Economic Thunderstorm Brewing: Unpacking the Vital Data Releases of May 23-26\n\nThe coming week of May 23 to May 26, 2023, holds several economic data releases that can potentially impact the market. On Tuesday, May 23, preliminary readings for the S&P Global Composite, Manufacturing, and Services PMI for May will be released, with the consensus for all three at 50, 50, and 53.6, respectively, indicating a stable outlook. New Home Sales data for April is also anticipated, with a consensus estimate of 0.663 million, slightly lower than the previous month's figure.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 24, the market will closely watch the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.\n\nA series of significant data will be released on Thursday, May 25, including preliminary data for the Q1 Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (expecting a 4.9% increase), Gross Domestic Product (forecasted at 1.1% annualized growth), and the GDP Price Index (forecasted at 4%). Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending May 19 are also expected, with a consensus estimate of 253,000, slightly above the previous week's number. Pending Home Sales data for April will be released, expecting a small rise of 0.2% after a significant drop in the previous month.\n\nFinally, on Friday, May 26, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index for April is due, with MoM and YoY consensus estimates at 0.4% and 5%, respectively. Durable Goods Orders for April are also expected, with the market preparing for a decrease. Personal Income and Spending data for April, both estimated to rise by 0.4%, will be released as well. The week will end with the release of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May, a significant indicator of consumer confidence.\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nThe technical outlook for SPY suggests a bullish bias overall. Important levels and targets have been identified for both upward and downward movements. The analysis indicates an anticipation of a minor or major pullback, with specific levels highlighted on the daily and 1-hour charts. On the 15-minute chart, a bearish bias is observed, accompanied by hidden divergence on the RSI, which indicates underlying weakness during retracements in a downtrend. Looking ahead to Monday, there is an expectation of a potential rejection at either the resistance line or the 419 level, creating a favorable opportunity to enter the market short towards the Bullish Order Block.\n\n## Weekly Chart\n\nBias: Bullish\n\nUpside Key Levels:\n\n* The previous weekly high of 420.72.\n* A small gap between 425.26 and 425.50.\n* Liquidity at 427.21.\n* A weekly order block ranging from 429.50 to 431.73.\n\nDownside Key Levels:\n\n* Previous weekly low of 408.87\n* Equal lows at 403.78.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf9p7yxqlz0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4901b5c576ff012e3ac9f4cb177b46e807c8d33c\n\n**Daily Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a56tblslz0b1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6c63fbc50fd350e8aeac6351541615bf7231dd24\n\nWe will either have a minor or major pullback/failure.

Overall the most interesting thing to me is that I didn\u2019t see anywhere that JPOW said we were going to pause in June at FOMC\u2026 However, the Market actually went from a 64.4% odds of a pause at open to now an 81.5% odds we pause at the June FOMC. \n\n**EVENTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8z5gdldnpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c199cf6150b775a6f6576455effc6a5890e95bb8\n\nLooking at next week really we do have some data to keep in mind and of course more fed speakers\u2026 most notable is that there is nothing on Monday. PMI Tuesday, Wednesday FOMC minutes will be the big one to keep an eye on\u2026 I actually have a strong suspicion that we will run Monday Tuesday then make Wednesday our top\u2026. Prelim GDP Thursday and then Friday is PCE, personal income and then lastly UMICH inflation. \n\nNot amazing data that I think sends us 1% +/- pre market but definitely stuff to keep an eye on. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\nI have great news for you guys! I spent a very long time doing some back testing (unfortunately its all manual). While I am no longer granted access to the other supply and demand indicator I have found high success and correlation with this new indicator I am using. I will not be sharing exactly how I derive these levels but they are very promising and I have been using it the last two days intraday day trading and I have had some amazing success. \n\nI look forward to these levels on a daily and weekly timeframe now and hope you guys enjoy them too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1pwwlxnpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db520b76907a562809728cdb743c592535ae861e\n\nFrom a supply and demand stand point here after we put in 410.2 demand (support) we have not looked back at all\u2026 we have flown through a ton of supplies from 413.05 to 419.5\u2026 419.5 was a major level that I was keeping an eye on and is a major pivot point. Now we did break over it and reject. However, note that this daily candle is NOT a double top. \n\nAlso note that after 419.5 there is no resistance or levels until 429.68. \n\nThe way I am reading this is that our target really should be 429.68. However, a few things we need to note\u2026 the weekly on SPY is about to enter extreme bull momentum. The DMI is almost extreme overbought also. There are a few other things I am watching too and most of those besides one is bullish. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br8eydeopu0b1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8d6dcc91d078f1037b66e1a6c910f253edc5afa4\n\nNow when I look at the weekly I think its very important to note that not only did we close over 416.08 weekly supply (resistance) but we also established a new demand (support) at 411.46 this week. We essentially retested and bounced off the now support of the range for the last almost 2 months and now we are on a push up.\n\nThe next major upside target is 427.35 supply from August. After that I don\u2019t have much until 453.23 (now I don\u2019t expect that to happen just noting). \n\nFrom a technical standpoint with us putting in a fresh demand (support) we should continue to expect upside until a new weekly supply (resistance) is put in. We also had a very nice bounce off the weekly 8ema. Now the difference from daily to weekly is that the DMI is not overbought at all and actually is in the process of waving up which means this bullishness on a weekly timeframe has a good amount left to go\u2026\n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axrcn72ppu0b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f5ae442d12ac6dfb5b75c81df51d38a2e648cf7\n\nWe remain in the black rising wedge on the daily and also have a smaller timeframe rising red wedge too. Now we were not able to close over 419.5 which in my opinion is a major pivot point. However this candle is not a true rejection and downside candle in my opinion either. \n\nThe most probable case is either a drop back to 416 to 416.8 to retest support and the daily 8ema before we push higher or there is a case where we see a pretty strong Monday and Tuesday run and then the markets negatively react to FOMC minutes and that becomes our temporary top. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk5w6ijppu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=128eaf1fff3e61a2f1d384fd6f830b92528a5139\n\nNow as I mentioned 427.35 was a weekly supply and target I had. IF you look at the weekly PA here we have a major resistance and pivot point there also from the August top. This in my opinion is 100% the next major resistance and the next major bull target to watch. \n\nNow that the bulls have officially broken out of this range we had been in for almost 2 weeks and have a nice weekly 8ema support bounce I will be looking for that continued upside. \n\nI honestly get told I am a permabear a lot.. but I really do play both sides\u2026 its just that from a macro/ economic/ just reality stand point we in no way shape or form should be looking at the 430s\u2026 honestly from a value standpoint I would say that 390s would be a fair price target right now. \n\nSPY Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5   \n Support- 412.1 -> 407.7 -> 404  \n Resistance- 418.6 -> 422 -> 427.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xq8likzppu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ffa2c0f2548f7670357329fcf3331dcb24f297dc\n\nOn futures daily S/D is the same story here\u2026 however, the difference is that we did put in that 4127 demand (support) and pushed through quite a few supplies\u2026\n\nWe did leave 4040-4055 supplies down low and now have a bigger sell off magnet to 4150-4154 also. However, the futures daily is a double top right now. The thing I am watching for to happen is that we immediately turn around and go from double top to double bottom off 4200. In doing so we should start to seek out upside still.\n\nThere is a chance that we could sell off Monday to establish 4216 as a new supply (resistance). In doing so we would take out 4190/4197 supplies. We would target a bounce off the daily 8ema near 4170-4180 for a support bounce. That would most probably establish a new demand which would give us the technical support to continue to push higher. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohw10vfqpu0b1.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c62ae484d004aad6d808930818dc16f9f58e192\n\nFrom the weekly here we did much like SPY establish a new weekly demand (support) at 4130 which is the bottom of our range that we have been in for the last 8 weeks now. Not only that but we are also going to completely bullishly engulf this last 2 months of trading with this closure over the 4193 supply. \n\nRight now my weekly target on Futes would be 4284. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujy531wqpu0b1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84f96f984a3741ce267a0ff0b78f73c2bf38bfb2\n\nFrom a price action stand point I mentioned that I would be curious if the daily could come back down to retest 4191 or not\u2026 We have officially at this point turned previous major resistance into now support. I would like to see one more closure over it and potentially even another bounce off it to feel 100% confident that it is support but this chart looks very bullish for me. \n\nOne note is that we still have not gotten through that 4240 resistance area from February highs. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhli4scrpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=086091f660a5ada8ead6131462edd1cb94094490\n\nThe first thing to talk about is that this was officially the 7th week post JPM collar roll\u2026 I have mentioned a few times that there is a historical trend of reversing the direction of the 7 weeks post leading into week 11. However, there is a few times where we have seen the trend actually explode even more. \n\nIt is possible that we could see another 4 weeks of running before we find a top\u2026 one other thing to mention is that the JPM collar calls are at 4300 and we have often touched that level before rejecting. \n\nThis weekly double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle in my opinion is very bullish and very strong for the bulls next week. However, we are now coming into some pretty strong resistance dating back to August. 4280 is the PA top from August which is right near that 4284 supply that I am targeting also. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4293 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4130 -> 4095  \n Resistance- 4200 -> 4223 -> 4280\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\nIt has been long requested that I include QQQ and I don\u2019t usually like to include anything more then I am already looking at but I do wanna start keeping a closer eye on Tech. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jantgsrpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=436f6ca47c29cc19a360fca12f9de9fb332150fb\n\nNow the QQQ daily is due for a pullback and I actually full expect to see that Monday. We today established a new supply at 337.29 and at the same time to the penny rejected my the demand level that has been level on the charts since March of 2022. So now that this demand level is finally taken out the question is what is next? \n\nFrom an S/D stand point once a new supply is established we look for a retrace to previous supply or the EMA (especially since we are in extreme bull momentum). For QQQ I see a pullback to 333.11 and if it wants to hold this yellow rising wedge it can drop no lower than 332 on Tuesday. \n\nThe daily 8ema is likely going to become a hard bounce and establish a new demand and even possible turn 333 supply into a demand. In doing so my upside target would be 347.11 supply and potentially on a huge blow off top 351.57 demand. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13gz1v9spu0b1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e69a4707f2664e96e54fe9772a5975ea4a1688d\n\nI find myself on QQQ weekly S/D feeling the same way I do about SPY weekly that a bigger upside move is coming. This week QQQ actually established a new demand (Support) at 322.47. In doing so it pushed hard through 330.67 supply. We now have about a $31 lull in levels where this is no clear resistance. \n\nHowever from a weekly stand point DMI is still waving up (bullish) and we are still in extreme bull momentum with some other technical also supporting a bigger move up or atleast bullishness.\n\nI would NOT be short QQQ until we see a new supply put in and even then I would only be short till we see the weekly 8ema. \n\n**VIX**\n\nLooking at the F/G index you can see we are nearing the same level of FG that we did almost a month ago when we were actually lower then current levels. IT would appear that the FG wants to push back into extreme greed. AT that time is when I would start to consider 60-90dte puts. My guess is that will be around the time FOMC happens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elwj4psspu0b1.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c07f8200491672749cf5fcd48ec8f66b56acc618\n\nNow one interesting thing about the VIX which also supports the bullishness on SPY/QQQ is the fact that we are in weekly extreme bear momentum on VIX. This means the downside should continue to be expected. \n\nWe did come down however and have a really nice inside candle body on VIX. We also attempted to get back over that critical 16.92 VIX level, however, we hard rejected the daily 8/20ema and closed in the 16s again. \n\nI actually in all honestly would not be surprised to see the VIXs in the 14s in the next week or two. \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2e7ryqdtpu0b1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4968299fa044a9ccf24e3a5660e5f635a01f9b34\n\nNow one thing I said I was very confused on is the fact that DXY and the 10YR rallied with SPY/QQQ. We should have seen the opposite affect. DXY did break its support line from this breakout\u2026. A bigger sell off in the DXY back to the 101-102 area could be the final push up on spy/ tech. I am also seeing the 10YR come into decent resistance here and would be surprised to see some weakness start to show up in the 10YR. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrqizqqtpu0b1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=664275698245567d32737262be1e6127eac1eb77\n\nI had a great day and an even better week trading. I actually during that JPOW speech hit a nice 50% gainer which I honestly cant remember the last time ive had a win that big. I unfortunately missed on my first put about 100% gainer but in the end profits are profits and you never know how those events are gonna go.\n\nI actually put in again my most profitable week of 2023 and my most profitable week since December of 2022. \n\nFrom a day trading stand point (as in not including swings or lottos) this is my most profitable week of strictly day trading since October 2022. \n\nI continue to find my confidence but also most importantly my patience in this market. I had a really big problem before of either not trusting myself or chasing plays too much. I have found myself now that I am okay missing a play as I know there will always be another play. I have also never felt so confident and trusting in my strategy that has proven itself to be worthy of the trust. \n\nI look forward to another great week of trading next week!",

Theoretical 3x high side. Looked at this for a bit but don't recommend as it erodes away over time and, overall, realized that the downside risk is much higher than the upside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**USB (US Bancorp)**: Currently looking at this one. Is beat up but is a much larger bank. Is large enough that deposits increased as customers pulled there money from smaller banks and put them into USB. Dividend yield is about 6% right now. Seems like solid long-term play with good upside of potentially doubling your money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts on this appreciated. Particularly, if anybody has looked at USB and has thoughts on it.",

        "title": "DD: New EPA PFAS Regulations = Big money for Chart Industries and Ecolabs",
        "selftext": "Water pollution, air pollution, we all hear about it in the news and are concerned about it. But did you know that you can profit from it? My grandfather always told me \u201cinvest in things that people have no choice but to buy\u201d and clean air and water is certainly such a necessity. Pollution remediation is big bucks, and its about to get even more costly and companies like **Chart Industries (GLTS), Ecolabs (ECL) and Kuraway** stand to profit immensely from it. The US Environmental Protection Agency, (the \u201cEPA\u201d) regulates clean air and clean water and has proposed major changes in both PFAS regulation and natural gas plant carbon emission standards. If same regulations go into effect, it will result in virtually every water company in America having to purchase PFAS remediation systems. [Likewise, nearly 32% of American electricity is currently produced using natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php) resulting in a large number of companies needed to purchase carbon capture technology systems to achieve compliance. This post will largely focus on the new PFAS water regulations.\n\n**PFAS**\n\n[The soonest anticipated change is a new EPA regulation that will limit PFAS in America\u2019s potable water supply to 4 parts per trillion, with the public comment period scheduled to end on May 30th for the proposed rule.](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas) It is widely expected that the new rule will pass. The term PFAS stands for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These chemicals are used as flame retardants, fire-fighting foams and as non-stick agents. They were frequently used in the past to manufacture of fire retardant furniture, non-stick pans and fire fighting foams. As a result they are spread literally everywhere in minute amounts throughout the country. [They are literally everywhere, even in the rain](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62391069). They also don\u2019t easily breakdown in the environment and thus have been referred to as a \u201cforever chemical\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PFAS EVERYWHERE](https://preview.redd.it/xsqjy2vpjt0b1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bda6bfc792950d86d0b3f7da161796885e0b545)\n\n[So why all the concern about PFAS? Well, it has been alleged that they can cause kidney cancer, testicular cancer and thyroid diseas](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/pfas)e even in very small amounts. However, there is currently no federal regulation at all about PFAS levels in drinking water. S[everal states have stepped in and have set forth their own regulations, these range anywhere from 5.1 parts per trillion in California to 140,000 parts per trillion for a specific PFAS chemical in Michigan.](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/state-by-state-regulation-of-pfas-substances-in-drinking-water.html)The EPA is proposing a federal limit of 4 parts per trillion to be enacted across the country.  This is an extremely huge change. To comply with any PFAS limitation by reducing contamination, a water company is required to purchase and install purifying systems to literally remove the PFAS from the water. These various technologies have different levels of effectiveness. Thus a water company in Connecticut that has already installed treatment systems to comply with that states 70 parts per trillion limitation may now be required to install a new more efficient system to comply with the new 4 parts per trillion federal regulation! The result is that nearly every water company in America will be forced to go out and buy PFAS treatment equipment all at the same time. Thus demand will skyrocket, while the supply of systems will remain largely unchanged over a short period of time. I[t is estimated that to comply with the new regulations would cost water companies $3.8 billion annually, with large start up costs.](https://phys.org/news/2023-03-pfas-1.html) The installation of treatment systems will result in recurring annual costs, because as water is treated the PFAS treatment systems themselves use up substances that must be replaced once they are depleted. There are two primary means currently used for the removal of PFAS from water. The first is granular activated charcoal. This is stored in a massive huge vessel with alternating layers of activated charcoal and other substances to literally scrub the PFAS out of the water. Eventually the activated charcoal becomes so loaded with PFAS (and other pollutants) that it must be replaced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A Calgon brand Granulated Activated Charcoal type PFAS filter, note its immense size](https://preview.redd.it/phiafc8rjt0b1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a060aae515d09613aa16321b5a37e1e6950627d)\n\nThe second primary means of removing PFAS from water is through an Ion exchange resin treatment system. This type of system uses a chemical that attracts and sucks PFAS out of the water and binds it to a resin. Like with the granulated activated charcoal, as water is treated the resin is used up and must be regularly replaced as water is treated. While the ion-exchange resin technology is more efficient, it also is more expensive than the granulated activated charcoal.\n\nGiven that public outcry regarding PFAS contamination has been growing for the past several years,  private equity firms and conglomerates have been buying up companies that produce PFAS treatment systems. [For example, one of the largest granulated activated charcoal producers in America is Calgon Carbon, which was purchased by the Japanese corporation, Kuraray in 2018.](https://www.calgoncarbon.com/media/press-releases/2018-09-03/6927/) Norit, another huge activated [carbon producer was acquired by One Equity Partners, a private equity firm, in 2022](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220302006084/en/One-Equity-Partners-Completes-Acquisition-of-Norit-Activated-Carbon/). If you have access to the Japanese market, Kuraway is publicly traded, but its ADRs barely trade here in the USA. So that begs to ask, Scipio, I\u2019m not a private equity bro, how can I, the everyday trader invest in PFAS remediation. There are two companies that I have identified that present such an opportunity.\n\n**Chart Industries (GTLS) \u2013 INVERSE CRAMER!**\n\nJust like the private equity firms I have mentioned, Chart Industries has jumped into the PFAS remediation game by acquiring AdEdge Water Technologies, a water treatment company. [This is something that Cramer completely overlooked when he recently shat on the company in a post in Januar](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/cramers-lightning-round-chart-industries-is-not-a-buy.html)y. AdEdge builds both granulated activated charcoal and ion-exchange resin type PFAS filtration systems. T[hey also signed a business referral deal with Calgon Carbon where anyone who contacts Calgon to purchase PFAS remediation systems of a certain size is immediately referred to Chart Industries AdEdge business.](https://www.calgoncarbon.com/media/press-releases/2022-09-06/chartwater-and-calgon-carbon-announce-referral-agreement/)This will ensure a steady flow of business to Chart for new PFAS clients. As an added bonus, Chart also builds carbon capture systems for gas fed power plants. Therefore, if the EPA\u2019s newly proposed gas fed power plant carbon emissions standards come into being, Chart will profit off that as well. [Finally, a big selling point for Chart is that their stock price is still heavily depressed from an overreaction related to their purchase of Howden, a gas and air handling products producer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/17/2629484/9318/en/Chart-Industries-Completes-the-Acquisition-of-Howden.html) However, despite the purchase and related negative EPS, Chart still showed earnings results that beat estimates in its most recent quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A collage of Chart Industries AdEdge brand PFAS charcoal filters](https://preview.redd.it/q7zu7vlujt0b1.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8cc3808516625144d1eaaede0f00cffa6b9d4780)\n\nEcolab (ECL) \u2013 Bill Gates clean water baby\n\n[As this autist pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13ewahu/it_takes_tinfoil_to_make_tendies_part_1_ecl), another major player in the clean water technology field is Bill Gates backed Ecolabs. However, what he missed was that Ecolabs stands to profit immensely from the new federal [PFAS regulations as in 2021 it paid $3.7 billion to purchase Purelite.](https://www.ecolab.com/news/2021/10/ecolab-to-acquire-purolite-to-life-sciences-critical-industrial-markets) Purelite is[one of the largest ion-exchange resin manufactures in the world.](https://www.purolite.com/index) As stated previously, any ion-exchange resin type treatment system uses up the resin as the water is treated. Thus, a steady stream of resin sales will continue indefinitely once the new Federal regulations come into effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ecolabs Purelite brand ion-exchange resin](https://preview.redd.it/xevp6m1njt0b1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a461d5469ed23ceda65f10ecc56a2744c7a5f27)\n\nI am long both GLTS and ECL with 141 shares of GLTS and 3 June 16 $120 strike calls and 20 shares of ECL\n\n[My positions](https://preview.redd.it/575ptpuyjt0b1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2c68e4dfe69c05a71ca9a5df16ea450cd72d806)",

        "selftext": "\nI was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \n\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\n\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.\n\nSeems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n## Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n## FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 73%. (Stats as of 2023-04-30)",

Particularly small/mid cap tech and growth stocks. With no catalysts to bail out the bear scenario, we can assume there won't be much reinforcement coming in to help shorts fight prices pushing up. And so focus will turn from large caps to oversold stocks which are mostly still heavily shorted. As the market gains momentum and confidence, it will look for any excuse to go after those short positions. Bulls have tasted blood and May may prove to be bear hunting season.

        "selftext": "Well it would appear for now the trend of two days of shorts covering and rallying is continuing. This momentum should come to an end tomorrow if the trend holds true\u2026 we will know for sure if that happens if we close a doji tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8qohjfosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e57511094b00278b8dc94c2ed9e1152eadb9975f\n\nWe surprisingly have no data tomorrow morning However we will have two fed speakers (the last of the 14 that spoke this week I believe) and then the granddad of them all\u2026 JPOW himself will be speaking at 11am regarding \u201cDue to participate in a panel discussion titled \"Perspectives on Monetary Policy\" at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, in Washington DC.\u201d \n\nNow if you know JPOW he has a history of walking up to the mic and haven\u2019t a lasting effect on the markets\u2026 we should absolutely expect some high volatility tomorrow. The most interesting thing to note that we will hear tomorrow is whether or not JPOW expects an additional rate hike in June. Any hint at another rate hike I would suspect that we see a pretty negative reaction. However, if he hints even briefly at a pause we likely could see a huge move up. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3stmlmuosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89002c555ff27f78f1725149164deb38ec9dfff8\n\nWhat truly is intriguing to me is that leading up to Jackson hole in August we did see a rally much like the last two days. The day before Jackson Hole closed at 419.51 and today we closed extremely close at that 419.23 level. This is the highest the markets has been in about 9 months. \n\nAs you can see we maintain this big rising wedge with the critical resistance and pivot point of 419.5. From here the way I see it is simple\u2026 tomorrow decides whether we start a move back to 405.3 or we start our next leg up and look for the 430s for the first time in 9 months. The rising wedge resistance sits at 422.07 for tomorrow. \n\nFrom here if we can close over 419.5 then the target would be 429.7 by end of next week. However, if this 419.5 becomes a nice double top or we get a nice doji reversal then I would start to think about that magnet 410-412 range. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Support- 416.8 -> 414.9 -> 412.3  \n Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7f2secpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c8d57e270659521bc7e6c97f865622f656b862c\n\nNow on futures this is where we have quite a bit of a difference in trend and levels\u2026 Jackson hole for Futes was at the 4283 level. However we closed at 4212 on futes which is where we have found support and resistance numerous times over the last year. \n\nAs of right now the black rising wedge remains in tact and tomorrows resistance for that sits at 4265. We have not on futures at least taken out the resistance area of 4215 to 4237 yet. This could provide a nice top. However, the daily candle here would suggest further upside tomorrow. The next major area of resistance that we will be looking for is the august highs around 4310 to 4395. The 4300s will remain the next target if this bullish momentum can continue. \n\nA backtest and confirmation of 4191 support would confirm upside momentum. That 4191 level provided resistance for a long time and bulls being able to turn that into support would be a huge win in their books. \n\nDaily futures Levels  \n Support- 4191 -> 4171 -> 4152  \n Resistance- 4236 -> 4280 -> 4310\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6mfj1wpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3341d242b3ffcc4974bc29024b77a12e09b1260\n\nNow as impressively as bullish as everybody is out there\u2026 my one little bit of hesitation on truly being bullish is the fact that the VIX is coming not major support\u2026 as you can see 16.07 was major support and now that we have breached that the next target would be 15.78. \n\nThe one question I would ask everyone is this\u2026 Going into a major event like JPOW speaking with the VIX only 3.3% away from its 52week low is the risk to the upside or to the downside? While its obviously not impossible for bulls to have another green day to end the week and to see the VIX see off to a new 52 week low\u2026 (a negative -6.7% drop on the VIX gets us into the 14s\u2026) I would definitely say the risk is to the downside on SPY not the upside\u2026 It will be much harder for the bulls to continue this rally with the VIX at this level. \n\nHowever, IF JPOW comes out and re-assures the markets that all is well\u2026 no recession, we might pause and that banks are super strong\u2026 well honestly that could be enough to get the VIX into its extreme reversion to mean 12-14 area that we have not seen since 2019. So ask yourself this before you fomo in at 420 and VIX 15/16\u2026 are we really in a market status and time frame like 2019? Or is this more 2020-2023? \n\nI think we are setting up for one amazing long put opportunity myself. I will be watching the VIX and SPY closely at EOD tomorrow for a possible 90-120dte put entry. \n\n**DXY and 10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqzuxvdqsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52b8b4aa275f7c59b632f02a5dd415d58077ae9c\n\nHonestly what truly is blowing my mind right now is the fact that the dollar and the 10yr has been rallying in sync with us\u2026. The last time DXY was at this level was March 20th when SPY closed at 393.74 and the last time the 10YR was at this level was March 15th when SPY closed at 389.28\u2026 call it $391 average and SPY is sitting almost $30 higher then it was last time DXY/ 10YR saw these levels\u2026 \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4cp3huqsn0b1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ba7a45e4d91fbd0b70d50eb138346a48d0bd278\n\nDespite the real rollercoaster of a day that SPY had I actually had a really solid trading day. This week is shaping up to be just as amazing as the last 2 weeks of trading. I still have my NVDA and TSLA puts that are absolutely worthless and even with that loss I will realize tomorrow this is going to turn out to be a great week. \n\nI play to trade fairly lightly once JPOW starts talking and I honestly don\u2019t hate the idea of a straddle going into it if premiums and IV are not too outrageous. IV is pretty low for tomorrow still and only have about a $3 move priced in\u2026 now that is 150% of the priced in move almost every single day this week so realistically a $4-5 move is probable tomorrow\u2026 meaning we either close the week out near 425 or near 415\u2026",

Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**\n\n* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.\n* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299\n\n* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change\n* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.\n* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.\n* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.\n* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.\n\nThis is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**\n\nThen why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:\n\n* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.\n* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.\n* The \"IT\" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?\n\nWhy $700 next year:\n\n* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year\n* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time\n* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.\n\n**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below.

The Conference Board forecasts a contraction of economic activity starting in Q2 leading to a mild recession by mid-2023.\u201d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p48wh3ten0b1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e51f7e4b645fb0212287cbecd1241af1ed43538a\n\nHowever, when looking at the breakdowns, we may be reaching a bottom very soon. Credit likely already bottomed out, the interest rate spread should narrow after the debt ceiling issue is resolved, and new orders are expected to show less negative growth in May, indicating a potential pick-up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chbllmayen0b1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42cb6a567dd649f6f83b1e10076bb757fc065f99\n\nThe Philly Fed Index came in at -10.4, surpassing expectations of -19.5 and showing improvement from last month's reading of -31.3. The Philly Fed survey presents a contrasting picture compared to the NY Fed survey on Monday. Business conditions are showing signs of improvement, albeit still contracting, particularly in the area of new orders.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxda4ll5fn0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd36c78be813d2ddf35c8312d625653a7311b4c3\n\nMeanwhile, travel spending is back.

In my opinion, this confirms that the recent rally was driven by an increase in risk appetite. However, for the rally to sustain, interest rates would need to decrease from this point onward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q48qqpnzfn0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7872cbe546768db8597ba2b99d111d600edc0dc6\n\nPiper Sandler's new \"art\" piece suggests selling your portfolio after summer vacation.

        "selftext": "TL;DR - A fed Pivot is not happening anytime soon. At best you will get a pause.\n\nTo everyone thinking the fed pivot is right around the corner:\n\nIf the economic storms get more difficult, traders and investors seem to think the Federal Reserve will be like a lifeguard and rescue all swimmers from the rip tides. Economists see such confidence as misplaced given the high inflation environment.\n\nIn general, investors and traders have been steadfast in their view they can count on the Fed to come running at the first hint of a downturn.\n\nTraders in derivative markets have partly walked back rate-cut expectations, but still see the fed-funds rate \u2014 now at 5% to 5.25% \u2014 falling back to above 4.5% by year-end.\n\nBehind this bet is the view that the central bank will pivot and lower rates at the first hint of a recession. After all, that was the Fed\u2019s response after the last series of rate hikes in 2018- 2019.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the playbook the Fed is following, economists say. The Fed has gone back to the lessons from the 1970s, the last time of high inflation.\n\nThe central lesson from that decade is that recessions don\u2019t lower inflation on their own. The only way to get price pressures to cool is if the Fed is willing to keep policy tight, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics.\n\nIf the Fed turned around and cut rates like the market is pricing in for 2023, it would create \u201cthe worst of all possible worlds,\u201d Brusca added.\n\nFed officials have been insisting they plan to keep policy \u201chigher for longer\u201d in this cycle.\n\nOn Monday, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin tied the strategy of holding rates high to research from his regional bank on the lessons of the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThe number one lesson from the seventies is don\u2019t quit too soon, don\u2019t back off from fighting inflation because you\u2019re worried about what the other consequences might be,\u201d Barkin said in a recent Bloomberg Television interview.\n\nIf the Fed doesn\u2019t finish the job, inflation will come back higher and the Fed would have to do even more damage to bring it down, Barkin added.\n\nThe late Marvin Goodfriend, the longtime director of economic research at the Richmond Fed, criticized Fed policy in the 1970s for being \u201cgo-stop.\u201d\n\nThe Fed would keep policy too easy and then slam on the brakes.\n\nUnder this approach, inflation drifted up in the 1970s. It took Paul Volcker to engineer a recession and hike interest rates to 20% to wring high inflation out of the system.\n\nBond and stock-market investors alike have convinced themselves that the Fed will cut rates quickly this year, said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America Securities.\n\n\u201cThe markets want to believe that the Fed is going to come to the rescue here. It is not just the bond market, \\[it\u2019s\\] the equity market also. They haven\u2019t convinced themselves that the Fed is going to accept the recession,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThat indicates Market participants don\u2019t appreciate how different this business cycle is from recent business cycles.\n\n\u201cThe Fed hasn\u2019t deliberately triggered a recession since Volcker. In all recent cycles the Fed backed off as soon as there was a whiff of recession,\u201d he said. They were able to do that because inflation was low, he added.\n\n\u201cYou really have to go back to the 70s and 80s to understand what they\u2019re up to. Today is a mini-version of that and recent business cycles are not very informative for what the Fed is doing,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s pivot in 2019, the last business cycle, was an experiment to allow the economy to run hot. \u201cThat experiment has failed miserably,\u201d Harris said.\n\nPredictions of a recession have ebbed and flowed since last summer. Right now, the number of economists predicting at least two quarters of contracting gross domestic product is rising.\n\nOne market-implied gauge saw over a 90% chance of a recession in the coming months. The Fed\u2019s staff said in March that a mild recession was their base case.\n\nMarket expectations of rate cuts did firm considerably after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March.\n\nGuy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said he thought the market pricing was reflecting the risk of the Fed having to slash rates in a banking crisis rather than one or two cuts.\n\nThe Fed has its first cuts penciled in for sometime in 2024. Officials see three 25 basis point cuts over that year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis article first appeared: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-fed-cuts-interest-rates-during-a-recession-it-would-be-the-worst-of-all-possible-worlds-a4be2f92?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-fed-cuts-interest-rates-during-a-recession-it-would-be-the-worst-of-all-possible-worlds-a4be2f92?mod=mw_latestnews)",

        "selftext": "\u201c**During a gold rush, sell shovels.\u201d** This saying arose following the California gold rush of the mid-19th century when it became clear that few prospectors made money panning for gold while the suppliers who sold them shovels and picks profited nicely. \n\n**I. Introduction** \n\nThis due diligence report focuses on the *Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)* and Autonomous Vehicles sector. It aims to provide an overview of the industry, including the latest technological advancements, market trends, and investment opportunities within this rapidly evolving field. Mainly, employing the strategy of \"During a gold rush, sell shovels.\" The aim is to identify key products and companies within the supply chain that can benefit from the industry's growth and technological advancements. \n\n**II. Autonomous Driving Technologies Industry Overview**\n\nADAS & Autonomous Vehicles industry is experiencing significant growth and transformation, driven by evolving consumer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory initiatives. These technologies aim to enhance road safety, increase transportation efficiency, and provide improved mobility options. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning algorithms to perceive the environment and make informed driving decisions. In USA, this industry is regulated by the *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).*\n\nAutomakers are moving past passive safety (airbags, seal belts, etc..) into active safety (ADAS features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, etc...).\n\nAutomobile OEMs are racing to deliver the first automobile offering level 4 ADAS system. Mercedes currently has level 3 offering to consumers. ADAS unlock a major source of subscription-based revenue for automobile OEMS. \n\nADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by *The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)*. ADAS can be divided into 5 levels:\n\n[5 levels of ADAS\\/AVs](https://preview.redd.it/fzfjl9nn5m0b1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88f6a64d59eda5088696454a11be86b0c71bb758)\n\n**III. Government Regulation**\n\n*National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)* and other agencies around the globe will regulate ADAS requirements and standards. Germany is leading the way with the USA following closely behind. Most likely, AVs will be required to have more than one type of sensor (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonics/sonar) to offer level 3 and above ADAS features. This is due to requiring a high degree of redundancy for safety reasons. \n\nIn my personal opinion, Tesla's pure camera vision is a bust. This is evident by the increasing number of accidents involving Tesla when Autopilot was engaged. Also, certain environmental factors can hinder cameras useless (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc..). Elon will never admit this and will blame his failures on government interference. \n\n**IV. Technological Advancements in the Supply Chain**\n\n The ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry has witnessed a surge in investments and strategic partnerships, indicating the growing interest and confidence in this sector. Established automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively pursuing collaborations to leverage their respective expertise and accelerate the development and commercialization of ADAS and autonomous vehicles. \n\nADAS = Chipmakers + Real Time Operating System + Automotive Cloud + Sensors + Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning \n\n*Chipmakers:*\n\n* Mobileye (Spun off, but still controlled, by Intel)\n* Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion Platform\n* Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Flex Soc\n\n*Real Time Operating System (RTOS):*\n\n* BlackBerry QNX already has deals with automotive OEMs to offer them their RTOS.\n\n*Automotive Cloud:*\n\n* Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (powered Microsoft Azure)\n* Blackberry IVY (powered by Amazon AWS)\n\n*Sensors:*\n\n* Microvision (LiDAR) - Most likely, all AVs that offer level 3 ADAS and above will need to be equipped with a lidar sensor. The LiDAR sector has consolidated, and MVIS aims to take over 50% of the automotive market. MVIS shareholders just authorized an additional 100 million shares. Currently, a major squeeze is being anticipated. Get in while you can!\n\n*Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:*\n\n* ADAS is going to be a major revenue stream for automotive OEMs. Most likely, will be a subscription-based model.\n* All the automotive OEMs have their own version. The race to offer Level 3 and above is currently underway. Here are a few examples:\n* Autopilot by Tesla\n* Bluecruise by Ford\n* Super Cruise by GM\n* Subaru Eyesight\n* Honda Automated Drive\n* Mercedes Drive Pilot (level 3)\n* ETC...\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n\nWhen considering investment opportunities in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle sector, it is essential to identify companies that demonstrate technological leadership, strong partnerships, and a clear roadmap for future growth. These companies are likely to be at the forefront of innovation and well-positioned to capitalize on the market trends and evolving consumer demands.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry is witnessing a transformative phase characterized by increased investment and strategic partnerships. Automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to advance technology, share resources, and accelerate the market adoption of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMy positions:\n https://preview.redd.it/eqo9kbg14o0b1.jpeg?width=1045&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a14b81a3c4e89b8b289d9f4507ffe0c38458587",

        "selftext": " \n\nSure, here is a Wall Street Bets Reddit style post about Kohl's (ticker symbol: KSS) that is bullish and uses as many rocketship emojis as possible, and also mentions Kohls Cash and how cool it is to be balling with Kohls Cash:\n\n**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 KSS TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nKohl's is the bomb-diggity, hunty. It's a retail queen that is poised to slay the competition. The company has been struggling in recent years, but it is now on the right track. Kohl's has recently made a number of positive changes, including investing in its e-commerce business and expanding its product offerings. These changes are already starting to pay off, as Kohl's sales have been increasing in recent quarters.\n\nIn addition to its strong fundamentals, Kohl's is also trading at a very attractive valuation. The stock is currently trading at just 10x earnings, which is a significant discount to its historical valuation. This makes Kohl's a very attractive investment for value investors.\n\nI believe that Kohl's is a stock that is poised for major gains in the coming years. I am bullish on KSS and I believe that it is a stock that all investors should consider adding to their portfolios.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote that illustrates why I'm so bullish on KSS. A few years ago, I was shopping at Kohl's for a new pair of jeans. I was looking for a pair that was comfortable and stylish, and I was having trouble finding what I wanted. I was about to give up when I saw a sales associate who was helping another customer. I asked the sales associate if she could help me find a pair of jeans, and she was very helpful. She showed me a few different pairs of jeans that she thought I would like, and she even helped me find a pair that was on sale. I was very happy with the customer service that I received, and I ended up buying a pair of jeans that I love.\n\nThis experience illustrates why I'm so bullish on KSS. The company has a great team of employees who are committed to providing excellent customer service. I believe that this commitment to customer service will help Kohl's to succeed in the years to come.\n\n**Yassification features:**\n\n* Added more exclamation points and emojis\n* Used more slang and informal language\n* Made the post more personal and relatable\n* Added a personal anecdote to illustrate the point\n* Made the post more fun and exciting\n\n**Kohl's Cash**\n\nOne of the best things about shopping at Kohl's is that you can earn Kohl's Cash. Kohl's Cash is a type of reward that you can use to save money on future purchases. You can earn Kohl's Cash by shopping at Kohl's or by signing up for the Kohl's Rewards program.\n\nKohl's Cash is a great way to save money on your next shopping trip. You can use Kohl's Cash on any purchase at Kohl's, including sale items. Kohl's Cash is also a great way to get a head start on your holiday shopping.\n\n**Balling with Kohl's Cash**\n\nThere's nothing like balling with Kohl's Cash. It's like having free money to spend on all the things you love. You can use Kohl's Cash to buy clothes, shoes, home goods, and more. You can even use it to buy gift cards for your friends and family.\n\nSo next time you're shopping at Kohl's, be sure to sign up for Kohl's Rewards. You'll be glad you did when you start earning Kohl's Cash and balling like a boss.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "CD Projekt's spot on the chart is interesting for buyers for a variety of reasons now.\n\nWe have a couple of potentially bullish patterns as well as rumours of Phantom Liberty releasing much sooner than expected -- in **June**.\n\nBullish patterns on chart:\n\n1. Possible bullish ABCD pattern on day charts (weak probability).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3x0197eppl0b1.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b22b145b1ca5c234f78b9edc1244eef14fda7af\n\n2.

Support at 61.8 fibonacci seems to hold well so far\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pvz5n5mrl0b1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=50f6ca48eae1b471cd982ed657782fb5a83e00cd\n\n**Risks**\n\n1. The stock is in a long term downward trend. So be aware that buying is **risky, maybe very risky**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shwiww4asl0b1.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4849e61caecd0f3e37507a522b97f0fe8bc1725a\n\n2. Recently SM50 and SM200 made a pattern of a death cross, which is currently the major technical bearish sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rds8np7fsl0b1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef1bb6500216501a1945d8663765f01e9e3455f3\n\n3. CD Projekt is shorted by 4 funds (we don't know how much in total, because the funds that short are only disclosed once they pass 0,5% in the registry). The total position currently is 3,88%. This is both bearish and bullish sign, since sooner or later they have to close their positions, increasing the price.\n\n[https:\\/\\/rss.knf.gov.pl\\/RssOuterView\\/faces\\/hspsList.xhtml](https://preview.redd.it/s6jsdwmtsl0b1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16d41ebaf75823d12e15b20ddf42cdfaf8cdd5ed)\n\n**Rumours**\n\nBecause of a podcast on YouTube from 2 well-known polish gaming journalists ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ItH7XyQIR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ItH7XyQIR0)), there's lot of rumours that the DLC to Cyberpunk 2077 called Phantom Liberty will be released in June or early July. \n\nLast year was the best year for CD Projekt out of all years without release, so the earnings from the DLC might make up for a great 2023 year.\n\n**Summary**\n\nUnexpected release of Phantom Liberty expansion to Cyberpunk 2077 in June with positive reception from players would heavily support current bullish patterns on the charts. However, be careful as the stock is in a downward trend for a long time. Buying now is essentially fishing for the dip.\n\n**Closing thoughts**\n\nI could make much longer, much more sophisticated post, but I'm tired and don't give that much fucks. You have to have the basic knowledge of what company it is, etc. There's a lot more things about the company (mainly bullish) to talk about, if the ppl would be interested I could make further posts.\n\n**Positions**: I have long positions (stocks not contracts) on CDR.PL with an average price of 116PLN.",

Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment\u2019s price.\u00a0\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\u00a0\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

Day Trading is based on ancient belief in lucky underwear. 'Ancient' == 'time tested'.   \nif you want to hold position for several days, your best bet is not to wear bra and have matching undies. \n4. Sex brings luck.  \nTell it to your girlfriend/lady next door/shop assistant in department store/arresting police officer .  It maybe not bring you luck, but at least you'll have sex. \n5. \\* After hours trading is for wimps.  \nYou trade options and shop closes at 4pm. Real men raise their drinks to celebrate daily losses after hours, not chasing square pennies in futile attempt to fool the fate.\n6. The only real technical analysis is 'gut feeling' .   \nYes, 'gut feeling' before lunch is different from 'after lunch' especially if you had questionable Mexican burritos, but so is stock market - ever noticed so called 'power hour' starting after 2pm - brokers go to lunch too and they may have burritos as well.\n7.

        "selftext": "This isn't really a pro/con article. Just wondering where the competition is.\n\nThe barriers of entry are certainly high. You need fabs, (or the ability to outsource it) but those are actually not that impossible to find. And even though it might take some time, there are dozens of foundries coming online in the next decade, which will help any newcomer ramp up. This is a great time to establish long-term contracts with manufacturers. Maybe even help INTC come back from utter failure. WTF happened to those cats? Remember when people didn't know if AMD would survive bankrupty because INTC was beating them senseless? Pepperidge Farm remembers.\n\nI digress.\n\nThe reality is NVDAs greatest tool in their arsenal, that will be the main obstacle for any competitor, is their long-developed software library: numerous SDKs, CUDA, various other APIs and tools given freely to developers (even though they cost billions to develop), etc.\n\nThey use these free tools to \"help\" developers integrate WOW features into their game's way ahead of schedule (even if most people's machine/monitor can't even utilize it): DLSS, Ray Tracing, PHYSX, 3D Vision, TXAA, Lovelace, Gsync, and a bunch of other crap I can't remember.\n\nIntegrating these features into their SDKs creates a symbiotic (parasitic?) relationship where Game developers almost require consumers to own NVDA cards to have the best performance and visual quality - an ouroboros of features feeding technology - Stupidity no one needs. C'mon gang, $1500 for a video card? \n\nI digress, again.\n\nThese do not seem insurmountable obstacles. Sure, it will take a god-like amount of money. But there are literally 100s of billions of $ sitting in private accounts waiting to invest in something. In 2021 there were 1035 IPOS, 2022 gave us 181, and so far in 2023, a grand total of 65. I won't even discuss SPACS or Chinese nonsense stocks - smart money is over that shit.\n\nVC & Angel investors are champing at the bit to invest in AI. And the only thing you have to show them are the margins. GG.\n\nIf this seems a hard sell - Recall a tale of a strange man who once told a bunch of billionaire investors (with a straight face) that he could simultaneously take on the car and oil industries. And he would do it by building electric cars. Electric cars that were fast and cool. All the investors had to go on was the abomination known as the GM EV1. And they gave him the $. This seems less daunting.\n\nSidenote: I would call the new company:  **AaEye**. Tagline: **We drank the Kool-(AI)D**",

        "selftext": "Nike, a global leader in athletic apparel and footwear, continues to thrive in the highly competitive market due to its strong brand presence, innovative product offerings, and strategic partnerships. One of Nike's most iconic and influential product lines is the Air Jordan shoes, which hold immense cultural and historical significance.\n\nThe Air Jordan brand, closely associated with basketball legend Michael Jordan, has revolutionized the sneaker culture and achieved unparalleled success. These shoes not only offer exceptional performance and innovative design but also serve as a fashion statement and collector's item. The enduring popularity of Air Jordan shoes is a testament to their iconic status and their ability to transcend sports and appeal to a wide audience.\n\nThe partnership between Nike and Michael Jordan, which began in 1984, marked a turning point in the sneaker industry. The Air Jordan line introduced groundbreaking designs, including the famous \"Jumpman\" logo, and created a global phenomenon that resonates with athletes, sneaker enthusiasts, and fashion-conscious individuals alike.\n\nThe success of Air Jordan shoes not only reflects their historical significance but also suggests a positive outlook for future sales. Nike's ability to generate excitement and anticipation surrounding new Air Jordan releases has consistently fueled demand and led to rapid sell-outs. Limited-edition models, collaborations with renowned designers, and strategic marketing campaigns further contribute to the exclusivity and desirability of Air Jordan shoes. This combination of factors positions the brand for continued growth and expansion in the future.\n\n#.\n\nAI: Nike has been actively incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into its business operations to drive growth, enhance customer experience, and optimize sales. Here are some key areas where Nike is leveraging\n\n1. Consumer Insights and Personalization:\nNike has been increasing its use of AI algorithms to analyze vast amounts of customer data, including purchase history, browsing behavior, and social media interactions, to gain valuable consumer insights. This data-driven approach enables Nike to personalize marketing messages, product recommendations, and offers, tailoring them to individual customer preferences. By delivering personalized experiences, Nike aims to deepen customer engagement, foster brand loyalty, and drive sales.\n\n2. Product Design and Development:\nAI now plays a crucial role in Nike's product design and development process. The company uses AI-powered software tools to streamline and enhance design processes, enabling faster prototyping and iteration. AI algorithms can analyze consumer trends, market demand, and performance data to identify opportunities for innovation and inform product development decisions. This approach allows Nike to create products that align with customer needs and preferences, reducing time to market and increasing the chances of success.\n\n\n#.\n\nNike's partnerships and sponsorships with major sports stars significantly contribute to its success and brand recognition. Collaborations with athletes such as LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, and numerous others enhance Nike's visibility and credibility in the sports industry. These partnerships not only serve as powerful marketing tools but also provide opportunities for co-branded product lines, unique collaborations, and innovative campaigns that resonate with consumers on a personal level. By associating its products with these iconic athletes, Nike strengthens its position as a leader in the athletic footwear and apparel market.\n\nFurthermore, Nike's commitment to innovation and technological advancements plays a pivotal role in its continued success. The company invests heavily in research and development to deliver cutting-edge products that offer superior performance and comfort. Nike's proprietary technologies, including Flyknit, React foam cushioning, and Air Zoom, provide athletes with a competitive edge and set the brand apart from its competitors. This emphasis on innovation ensures that Nike remains at the forefront of the industry, attracting consumers who prioritize quality, performance, and style.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, several positive signals can be observed in Nike's stock chart. The stock has demonstrated a consistent upward trend over time, indicating a steady and consistent increase in value. Strong support and resistance levels have formed, suggesting a stable price floor and potential for further price appreciation.\n\nAdditionally, the stock has exhibited bounces off moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment. These moving averages act as dynamic support levels, indicating that investors have consistently viewed price dips as buying opportunities. Moreover, volume surges during upward price movements suggest strong buying interest and investor confidence in the company's prospects.\n\nTechnical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can also be considered. The MACD line remaining consistently above the signal line indicates a bullish bias, suggesting that positive momentum is in favor of the stock. Furthermore, the MACD histogram displaying positive values reinforces the notion of upward momentum and potential further price appreciation.\n\nIn addition to the positive technical indicators mentioned earlier, another significant development in Nike's stock chart is the formation of a bullish chart pattern, such as an ascending triangle or a cup and handle pattern. These patterns often indicate a period of consolidation followed by a potential breakout to the upside, suggesting the possibility of further price gains in the future.\n\nFurthermore, Nike's strong financial performance and consistent revenue growth provide additional support for its positive outlook. The company has a proven track record of delivering solid financial results, demonstrating its ability to navigate through various market conditions successfully. Nike's robust sales figures, driven by both online and offline channels, underscore its strong brand appeal and customer loyalty.\n\nMoreover, Nike's strategic investments in advertising and marketing have played a crucial role in elevating its brand image and expanding its customer base. The company's innovative and captivating ad campaigns, featuring both renowned athletes and inspiring narratives, resonate with consumers worldwide. Nike's ability to connect with its target audience on an emotional level has solidified its position as a cultural icon and contributed to its continued success.\n\nAnother notable aspect of Nike's business strategy is its focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility. The company has made significant efforts to reduce its environmental footprint and promote ethical practices throughout its supply chain. Nike's commitment to sustainability not only aligns with the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products but also positions the company as a responsible corporate citizen, enhancing its reputation and attracting socially conscious consumers.\n\nAdditionally, Nike's strong global presence and expanding market reach provide a solid foundation for future growth. The company's international operations, particularly in emerging markets, present significant opportunities for revenue expansion. As disposable incomes rise and consumer preferences continue to shift toward athleisure and sportswear, Nike is well-positioned to capture market share and drive sales growth in these regions.\n\nOne key aspect that supports the notion of Nike not being overpriced is its valuation relative to its industry peers. When comparing Nike's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to other companies in the apparel and footwear industry, it is apparent that Nike's valuation remains reasonable. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a fair price for the company's earnings potential and growth prospects. Furthermore, Nike's P/E ratio has historically traded at a premium compared to its competitors, indicating market confidence in the company's ability to deliver strong financial performance.\n\nNike's dominant position within the industry is another crucial factor contributing to its positive outlook. The company has established itself as a market leader, capturing a significant share of the global athletic footwear and apparel market. Its strong brand recognition and reputation for quality and innovation have allowed Nike to maintain a competitive edge over its rivals. The company's extensive distribution network, encompassing both physical stores and e-commerce platforms, further solidifies its market dominance.\n\nIt's worth noting that Nike's dominance in the industry is not solely based on its historical success but also on its ability to adapt to changing consumer trends. The company has demonstrated its agility and forward-thinking approach by embracing technology and digitalization. Nike's investment in digital platforms, such as its Nike App and SNKRS app, has facilitated direct engagement with consumers, enabling personalized shopping experiences and fostering brand loyalty.\n\nMoreover, Nike's recent foray into the direct-to-consumer (DTC) model has proven successful. By focusing on selling products directly to customers through its own channels, including online platforms and Nike-owned stores, the company has gained greater control over its brand image, customer relationships, and profit margins. This shift toward a DTC strategy not only enhances Nike's competitive advantage but also positions it to capitalize on the growing e-commerce trend and consumer preference for seamless shopping experiences.\n\nIn terms of potential upside, Nike's recent expansion into new markets and product categories presents significant growth opportunities. The company has been actively targeting emerging markets, such as China and India, where rising disposable incomes and a growing middle class have fueled demand for sportswear. By tailoring its marketing strategies and product offerings to local preferences, Nike has successfully gained market share in these regions, with ample room for further penetration.\n\nFurthermore, Nike's diversification beyond footwear into apparel, accessories, and digital fitness platforms has expanded its revenue streams and customer reach. The company's ability to leverage its brand equity and cross-sell products to its existing customer base enhances its growth potential and creates additional avenues for revenue generation.\n\n- \n-\n\nNegative Factors:\nCompetitive Landscape: Nike operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from other athletic footwear and apparel brands. Competitors may introduce innovative products or implement aggressive marketing strategies, posing a threat to Nike's market share.\n\nNike has a well-established brand with a loyal customer base, strong product portfolio, and robust marketing capabilities. The company's ability to innovate, respond to market trends, and maintain strong relationships with athletes and influencers positions it favorably to mitigate competitive challenges.\n\nSales Growth and Investments in Advertising:\nNike's sales growth and investments in advertising have been crucial drivers of its success. However, potential negative factors should be considered.\nNegative Factors:\n\n Economic Conditions: Economic downturns or recessions can impact consumer spending habits, leading to reduced discretionary spending on athletic footwear and apparel.\n\nWhile economic conditions can influence consumer behavior, Nike's strong brand loyalty and global market presence provide a degree of resilience. Moreover, the company's diverse product offerings cater to different consumer segments and price points, reducing vulnerability to economic fluctuations.\n\nSignificance of Air Jordan Shoes:\nThe Air Jordan brand holds significant value within Nike's portfolio, contributing to its overall brand strength. However, potential challenges exist that could affect the brand's performance.\nNegative Factors:\nChanging Fashion Trends: Consumer preferences and fashion trends evolve over time, which may impact the desirability and demand for Air Jordan shoes.\n\nNike has a long history of adapting to changing trends and consumer preferences. The company's focus on innovation, collaborations, and limited-edition releases helps maintain the appeal and exclusivity of Air Jordan shoes. Additionally, the loyal following and emotional connection associated with the brand are likely to provide continued support.\n\nPartnerships with Major Sports Stars:\nNike's partnerships with major sports stars have been instrumental in building its brand image and expanding its reach. However, certain risks should be considered.\n\n#\n Reputation Risks: Any negative publicity or controversies involving endorsed athletes could potentially impact Nike's brand perception.\n\nWhile reputation risks exist, Nike has a well-established process for selecting and managing its partnerships. The company prioritizes athletes who align with its values and have a positive influence on consumers. Moreover, Nike's extensive portfolio of athletes allows it to diversify and mitigate risks associated with individual endorsements.\n\nCounterfeit and Imitation Shoes:\nNegative Factor:\nCounterfeit and imitation shoes pose a risk to Nike's brand reputation and market share. The availability of cheaper alternatives could potentially attract price-sensitive consumers away from authentic Nike products.\n\nPersonally i know many people who have tried to buy counterfeits. They have all told me its more expensive than you think, and extremely complicated to do. You need to pay a third party chinese person just to ship the goods for you and it gets very complicated and expensive. Medium-to-large orders and imitations of expensive shoes are at risk of being seized by customs. Damage to brand reputation remains a real risk.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nWhile Nike faces potential challenges and negative factors, its positive outlook and growth potential remain strong. The company's ability to adapt to competitive landscapes, maintain brand loyalty, innovate in response to changing trends, and manage partnerships positions it favorably for continued success. While no investment is without risks, Nike's steady and consistent upward stock price, sales growth, and dominance in the industry suggest that it will continue to consistently provide positive returns to investors in accordance with its past, consistent results.\n\n\nLISTEN UP APES: decisions should be based on thorough research, analysis of individual risk tolerance, and if possible a consultation with a financial advisor. This is my DD and invest at your own discretion and don't be afraid to do your own research.\n\nIn typical WSB fashion-\nPosition 15k worth of 6/16 130c",

Dealer  gamma remains close,  making it challenging for the market to move below  4000 or above 4200.  The market experienced a weaker sentiment, with  credit spreads and high  yield spreads rising. The Nasdaq reached YTD  highs, while small caps  experienced a momentary bullishness that  quickly reversed. The S&P  500's breadth models indicated a  disproportionate weakness, with only  28% of the index trading above  their respective 20-day moving averages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ GEX\\/GAMMA - SPX 5\\/17\\/23](https://preview.redd.it/ku6wapq5lg0b1.png?width=2127&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3600d9121f9f0df7a68b207b79ee90d72223b166)\n\n**MSI Indicator**:\n\nThe  recent MSI and VIX signals show a  mixed market sentiment. In the last  few days, the MSI has been declining  from a high of 2.01 on 2023-05-05  to 0.69 on 2023-05-16, indicating a  shift from strong positive  sentiment to a more neutral sentiment. The  VIX has been oscillating in a  range of 15.78 to 20.09, which is  moderately high, suggesting a degree  of uncertainty and volatility in  the market. As the MSI approaches  zero, the market is becoming more  sensitive to sudden changes  influenced by the VIX. Traders should  exercise caution in this market  environment. Those with long positions  may consider adding hedges to  protect their investments, while others  should keep a close eye on the  MSI and VIX to identify potential market  trends and adjust their  strategies accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ MSI\\/VIX - SPX 5\\/17\\/23 ](https://preview.redd.it/ly3zzggflg0b1.png?width=7824&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39e4c4cf70ca49d222c71bcc8fd6207b38a0bb72)\n\nGiven the current market sentiment, here are some potential scenarios for SPY on 5/18/2023:\n\n1. **Bullish Scenario**:  If the market continues to show resilience as it has in recent days, we  could see a continuation of the upward trend. This could be further  supported if there's positive news from the meeting between McCarthy and  Biden regarding the debt ceiling agreement. In this case, SPY could  potentially move towards the flipping point at a strike of 417.1, as  indicated by the GEX analysis.\n2. **Bearish Scenario**:  If the market reacts negatively to the declining MACD on the weekly  chart and the slowing GDP growth, we could see a downward movement in  SPY. This could be exacerbated if there's no agreement on the debt  ceiling, leading to a potential market sell-off.\n3. **Neutral Scenario**:  Given the mixed market sentiment indicated by the MSI and VIX signals,  the market could also remain relatively stable, with SPY oscillating  around its current levels.\n\n**RainbowAlgo Signal Recap**\n\n5Min Chart\n\n[ RainbowAlgo - SPY 5M 5\\/17\\/23](https://preview.redd.it/3auxdsrklg0b1.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a0a5c8c6c864fb11513463f7198be4619b5a9ff)\n\n15Min Chart\n\n[ RainbowAlgo - SPY 15M 5\\/17\\/23 ](https://preview.redd.it/18rlsxhzlg0b1.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=181913b967ca31c5dcc00b47b6e08e856ccd1797)\n\n**Disclaimer:**  RainbowAlgo and all affiliated parties are  not registered as financial  advisors.

Building permits -1.5%, falling short of the estimated 0% and improving from the previous month's -3%. As I mentioned yesterday housing data is considered a leading indicator of economic health. Today's market rally was largely fueled by this data.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnggqxjxeg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08d765f1ab2356cac433f73eb00fb0ddc3bf5fd0\n\n[Housing and vehicles appears to have bottomed out](https://preview.redd.it/pa9rjw58gg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cfc190b0dc178c4eacdb7eb7c8ab2504f2980189)\n\nAtlanta Fed up-revised GDPNow again today to 2.9% after strong housing starts report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/daqj1gr9fg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6fab5e3f64b6e170795066b977c5d761425e925\n\nJPM is still projecting a mild recession.

Regardless of what the NBER .. decides, a period of very weak growth .. will likely continue through next year.\u201d\n\n**The Business**\n\nThe market seems to believe that the worst of economic concerns has passed. Confidence has been boosted by stabilizing housing data, retail sales, and industrial output (mostly auto). Many of the most beaten-up sectors experienced a rally today. Even companies like HD, TGT, which gave horrible guidance, saw significant gains (not to mention KRE). It appears that the market has shifted back to a risk-on mode.\n\nDepartment stores rallied despite retail traffic just reached a new low last month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfn577c6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fac12cfe50ccf7d9efc0bed460c632192f376370\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihr20qbrhg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db6d9e916cdf80c5f8b510e7c48313de7dd5009d\n\nAirline rallied despite consumer spending on travel declined further in April.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvkfm7c6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e2795bb6994955ddf32d306368125b88fa71549\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19qw3ijwhg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c371b44a1ef44ab9e8984ca245ad672f537a3419\n\nKRE rallied today without obvious headline news\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k44uob6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12490153ac8e59bdccb38d3e27adb226cf87b81b\n\nI closed my puts today. Even though I still don't believe there is much upside, I am not sure whether we will have a big pull back soon either. Looks like sector rotation has started instead.

        "selftext": "Based on my trade history these stocks are soon going down. \n\nStrategy: Buying Twitter and Tesla Stock\n\n1. The Twitter Challenge: It's no secret that Elon Musk is an avid Twitter CEO, and his tweets often impact the market. So, how can we hit him where it hurts? By selling up Twitter stock and having a say in its future! Let's take this opportunity to influence the platform that Elon uses to voice his thoughts and influence the market. Together, we can make a difference.\n2. Tesla Stock Dilemma: We've all seen how Tesla stock behaves. Elon's tweets often lead to wild fluctuations, making it hard for many to predict its next move. But, here's the twist: What if we unite and turn the tables? By selling up Tesla stock, we can counteract those unpredictable fluctuations and send a message that the WallStreetBets community means business.\n\nWhy This Plan Works:\n\n1. Strength in Numbers: When we act as a collective force, we have the power to make a significant impact. Imagine the sheer volume of shares we can null if we all sell Twitter and Tesla stock together. Our numbers can disrupt the market and put pressure on Elon Musk's ventures.\n2. Creating Volatility: Elon Musk's influence often leads to volatility in the stock market. By taking a stand and actively participating, we can challenge this volatility head-on. With enough selling power, we can push the stock prices in unexpected directions, forcing Elon Musk and the market to take notice.\n3. Making Our Presence Known: WallStreetBets is known for its audacious moves and ability to influence the market. By executing this plan, we can show the world that we're not just a community of meme traders. We're here to bring about change and have our voices heard.\n\nRemember, this plan is not without risks. Stock markets are inherently unpredictable, and individual actions may not guarantee specific outcomes. Additionally, please conduct your due diligence and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\nLet's band together, WSB! It's time to challenge the status quo and make a statement. Together, we can take on the titan that is Elon Musk.

        "selftext": "Well if someone would have told me EOD yesterday that we were going to see 415+ on SPY today I would never have believed them\u2026 however, that was one impressive and incredible intraday rally which led us to where we are currently. Now the question is after the brutal bear trap yesterday\u2026 is this a bull trap in the making or is this the breakout of the range? \n\nNote- I am no longer including Supply and demand in my TA\u2026 as I mentioned that was an indicator that was not available to the public. I was blessed to use that indicator while I did. I am however out of my testing period of it and not able to access it anymore. I will be spending my weekend doing some extensive backtesting and revamping my indicators to fill the void of that. \n\nI am hoping by end of the weekend (planning to spend a sizable amount of time on this) I will have some sort of supply and demand to share with you guys. I have a few things I want to test out just need to spend the time actually testing them\u2026 just wont have the time intraweek to do that. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3099h52ndg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f4ef2bb6bcbf04af22e5410c92a3a79717b718a\n\nYesterday was the ultimate bear trap in that we closed below the 7 day range of 410.9 to 413.9. However, as today would show that was clearly a bear trap and a fake break down. Now if you watched the charts intraday today you would see that from 1130a until 145pm SPY went on a massive rally of almost $4. What truly is impressive about this a few things\u2026 Apple until EOD didn\u2019t join the rally at all, we didn\u2019t really get any noteworthy news that would explain this run up (biden said the next talk was Sunday but gave no concrete evidence of a debt ceiling solution), the dollar AND the 10yr both rallied today. \n\nSo the question would be was this a shorts covering/ squeeze rally or is this a sustainable rally starting here? \n\nThe biggest thing I note here is while we did break that 410.9 to 413.9 range\u2026 we did not break through 415.9 resistance established on 4/28. Not only that but we did fill the 415.27 gap today and pretty hit a brick wall with a retrace EOD off these levels. \n\nNow usually I would say this is a top and a clear rejection where we should expect a retrace. However, this daily candle reminds me a lot of previous shorts covering rallies that made no sense from a technical stand point. In general these are usually two day rallies. \n\nFor me here in order to be bullish and expect further upside (target would be 419.5+) I would want to see bulls continue this rally tomorrow and close over 415.9. \n\nHowever, there is a sizeable chance since realistically nothing has changed the last 2-3 months of trading that we actually are still in the bigger broadened 404.3 to 415.9 range. All eyes will be on 415.9 at close tomorrow. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Support- 412.3 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  \n Resistance- 415.9 -> 416.9 -> 419.5\n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7ps5lnndg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d2f383417d91340e022c861ee90859bd58f7d30\n\nFutures daily actually had the clearest lower highs trend that was going on since May 1st peak, however, today big move up went ahead and negated that. We are now seeing a massive bullish engulfing daily candle on futures. However, it has come into contract with the 4179 resistance and hard rejected. This area would be similar to that 415.9 area I mentioned. \n\nFrom here the question will be are we still trading in a bigger broad 4190 to 4075 channel or did we see a drop in order to find a new higher high? \n\nAs of right now much like SPY I find it hard to be sustainably bullish until we see a daily closure over this 4190 resistance and top from May 1st.\n\nIf we break through that and more importantly close over it then I would start to target 4212 and 4237.\n\nHowever, if this is still the broad channel 4179-4190 should hold as resistance and we should look for a retrace back to 4154 and 4125 support area. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Support- 4154 -> 4125 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4173 -> 4179 -> 4190 -> 4212\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjaae35odg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff8c58eedf343c64573b74806053bbdc672d7b47\n\nOn the VIX daily I have been watching this 16.79 to what was 17.73 channel resistance for just as long as we have been watching the channel on SPY.\n\nThe VIX daily did come up and make a nice double top rejection off 17.97 today so that now is our channel resistance. What I find most interesting is that the VIX came down and tested 16.79 support EOD and did manage to close over that level at 17.3.\n\nAs I have said for a little while now\u2026 the VIX has been pretty on point with SPY price action. If we were to see the VIX lose 16.79 support tomorrow and make a push for the 15.72 area then my anticipation would be that we do indeed break through 416 and look for 420 area\u2026 However, if the VIX can put in support here and start a push back to the high 17s or even 18s tomorrow then I would feel fairly confident that a SPY will respect this upper limit of its range with a closure under 415.9 which would then make our target once again that 411/4153 magnet area on SPY/ Futures. \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d9owimodg0b1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02c6abe36683fbe00a4035f34ea59d6599dcafd8\n\nI actually think what is the most interesting thing about today is the fact that the Dollar found strength once again and did push for a new recent high. In general one should not expect stocks to be rallying with the dollar\u2026 and perhaps that\u2019s why Apple for most of the day showed the weakness it did.\n\nAlso today we saw strength return to the 10yr and it continues on its breakout channel here. \n\nFrom a correlation stand point the last time the VIX was at 16.86 was 5/12 and SPY closed at 411.59. The last time DXY was at 102.882 area was 4/3 when SPY closed at 410.95 and the last time the 10YR was at 3.577% was 5/1 when SPY closed at 415.51.\n\nThe 10YR would be pretty correlated here with SPY closing at 415.23, however, VIX and DXY would suggest that an equivalent closure at $411.27 would be more appropriate. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3tzn70pdg0b1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc4ec21f9d61debac09dfaa84858ac1374ddf01a\n\nOverall not a bad day of trading even with my lotto swing put that closed at a full loss I was able to secure a green day today. I missed out on most of that intraday pump as it was just so wild to me that I never felt like I had a confident and non FOMO entry. Honestly that is the worst part about trading days like today for me at least when the trend is running on extreme momentum it always feels like you are entering on hope that the trend continues in your direction and that you didn\u2019t just buy the top.",

        "selftext": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to release its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results today, on May 17. Analysts are estimating an earnings of $0.972 per share as opposed to earnings of $0.870 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. The company anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues to increase in the range of 11-13% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 96 and 98 cents per share.\n\n**Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Results**\n\nRemember when the world's supply chains were fucked? Well Cisco\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to benefit from the easing supply chain constraints. Its extensive product portfolio and varied end-user base are also expected to have positively contributed to its top-line growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s results in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to benefit from strong demand for the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo solutions. If you guys have never heard of any of these things, it doesn't really matter. That's why I'm doing the research for you. \n\nCisco has been witnessing robust demand for its 400-gig products and the trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, the availability of Microsoft Teams on Cisco meeting room devices is expected to have driven demand for these types of devices.\n\n**Payment Plan To Boosts Revenue**\n\nEarlier this month, Cisco launched its \"[Capital Business Acceleration Program.](https://futurumresearch.com/research-notes/cisco-capital-business-acceleration-program-rolls-out-buy-now-pay-later-financing/)\" It allows customers who place orders before July 29 to defer payments until 2024. Anyone know who Raymond James is, the analyst from Simon Leopold? He mentioned that \"Cisco Capital flexes its muscle on occasion, so this is *not* a new play,\" in a note to clients. \"Bears may see the move as a sign of weakness. Bulls will look at it as (Cisco) leveraging its balance sheet advantage versus competitors.\" So here, are you a bear or a bull?\n\nThe deferred payment plan likely will help boost orders in the next quarter, analysts say.\n\nAt Barclays, analyst Tim Long said also in his note to clients: \"We expect a decline of 25% to 30% in orders year-over-year for the April quarter.\" Yikes. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall said in a note: \"Heading into Q3 we expect backlog to continue to provide support to revenue, putting more risk on the orders number as checks continue to point to softer enterprise demand.\" Marshall expects federal government orders to be strong.\n\n**Order Decline Expected In April Quarter?**\n\nHeading into the Cisco earnings report, the company owned a Relative Strength Rating of 65 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). \n\nIn addition, Cisco has shifted away from its core business of selling network switches and routers. With acquisitions, Cisco has aimed to increase revenue from software and services.\n\n\"Orders were likely soft during the April quarter,\" CSCO stock analyst David Vogt of UBS said in a note. \"While we expect in-line fiscal Q3 revenue and EPS as improving supply chain drives a faster backlog drawdown, product orders could be down 15% to 20%, versus minus 22% in fiscal Q2.\"\n\n**What do I expect during their call?**\n\nI expect Cisco\u2019s revenues for the quarter to expand, driven by the previously mentioned easing of supply chain constraints which are helping the company to clear its backlog for its networking products. Gross margins could also see a slight improvement, driven by easing inflation and improved supply. Last earnings, the company indicated that new orders have also been strong, noting that it saw double-digit sequential order growth from the commercial and enterprise space, with demand from the public sector also rising. Cisco is also likely to remain a key beneficiary of rising spending on cloud computing. Cisco has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and services contracts, and we will be tracking the company\u2019s performance on this front. Over the last quarter, total annualized recurring revenue stood at $23.3 billion, up 6% year over year.\n\nI believe the Cisco stock is undervalued at the current market price of about $47 per share. I think the company will perform better than its big tech peers in the event of a potential economic downturn given the secular spending trends on digitization and networking. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock hit high 50s in the short term. \n\nFor Earnings, I'm getting a call spread. I'm going to buy the 5/19 48c for $88 and sell the 50c for $27. This means I can get the spread for $61, offering a max profit of about 228%. That is, if the stock can go up ~5.3%. Last earnings, it went up over 6%, so let's see. That being said, now that I've actually put out this post, I wouldn't be surprised if CSCO crashes. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we should be looking at before making any sort of earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.",

Robbinhood69, u might ask, was their recent earnings good ?\n\nWell, they had expected revenues of 716 million and reported 548 million. Expected EPS .95 and reported .40\n\nRobbinhood69, was their guidance good ? They always guide stupidly optimistic\n\n[Here](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-2022-Guidance/default.aspx) was their 4th quarter guidance for 2021, they guided EPS of 0 to 60 cents\n\n[Q1](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-First-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) 2022 was   -41 cents, [Q2](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was 52 cents, [Q3](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2022/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was -46 cents, [Q4](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2023/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022-Financial-Results-and-2023-Guidance/default.aspx) was 7 cents for a total loss of -41 cents for 2022. BUT if you look at their Q4, they are projecting a 2023 EPS of 7 to 8 DOLLARS a share. How did [Q1](https://investor.firstsolar.com/news/press-release-details/2023/First-Solar-Inc.-Announces-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx) 2023 go? Decent, 40 cents a share profit, with them reiterating their guidance which includes 660 million to 710 mil \"Section 45x\" tax benefits. This, you probably already knew, is the inflation reduction act tax benefit, which IMO is going to be the first thing cut during debt ceiling resolution.\n\nWall St has been asleep at the wheel allowing FSLR to guide high while losing money pursuing a growth at all costs strategy, which works until it doesn't. What could be the catalyst to kick the teeth in on this company trading at 8x forward P/S ? IMO it is the debt ceiling negotiations. The only serious proposals I've seen from the republican side (which IMO have a bit of an upper hand here) are cutting in these 4 areas - SNAP benefits, IRS budget, student loan forgiveness, and solar tax subsidies. Out of those 4 areas IMO the most palatable one is gonna be solar, that is not gonna cost either side voters and in general solar has already been a win for Buyden since a lot of solar demand got pulled forward from the inflation reduction act. Dems are gonna have to give in somewhere and IMO it's gonna be solar.\n\nWhat does that do to FSLR ? THey directly get 660 million to 710 million in tax benefits, in addition their industrial customers get 1 of 2 tax benefits outlined [here](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/federal-solar-tax-credits-businesses), namely 30% tax credit on total cost OR a per kwh subsidy of 2.75c/kWH. FSLR is gonna get fucked, and their customers are gonna get fucked, and if you are a bull holding a stock that has generally overpromised and underdelivered on the cusp of losing a massive tailwind why would you continue to hold ?\n\nPositions Dec 150p and 130p, I will hold until Cramer gets bearish on this stock and says something like \"with congress cutting solar subsidies i don't know how you can own this stock\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqvgffijwe0b1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f3b1b30d9b4f708020a05a861bdf55125833277",

For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious\nmistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.\n\n\"The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground\".\n\"Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?\"\n\u201cIdk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted\".\n\nWherever he went , \"off colour\" remarks were expressed.\n\nAt the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you.

As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis\".\n\nIn Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.\nHe wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle \ud83d\udd34 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, \"The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate\". In it, he was quoted as saying \"bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully\".\n\nConvinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.\nHe sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98\u2019. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter\ndismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.\nHe eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted \"THIS ISNT FAIR\", that\u2019s his mans, Burry, walked in, \"Honey, your salmon\nis here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.\u201d With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place \ud83c\udfe1.

Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.\n\n\ud83d\ude0f TLDR: BUY NVDA PUTS \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f",

        "selftext": "Mornin' - [Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13dqexw/morning_briefing_may_10th_2023/). The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 300 points yesterday, dragged down by disappointing quarterly results from Home Depot and weaker-than-expected retail sales for April. Investors will also be looking ahead to the latest debt ceiling developments out of Washington and Target's earnings report on Wednesday. Target's results came in a little better than expected, but the company warned that shoppers are paring back their spending on discretionary items and buying more essentials like groceries. Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington said that \"consistent inflation, the running out of savings as well as just economic uncertainty in general is having an impact on their choices and they're making tradeoffs.\" Digital sales fell as foot traffic at stores increased slightly. CEO Brian Cornell said that online deliveries tend to be more in the discretionary category, while same-day curbside pickup orders are more focused on daily necessities. Cornell also said that the retail giant is on track to lose $500 million this year from theft and overall \"shrink,\" compared with last year. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with the big four congressional leaders as they work toward averting the first-ever default in U.S. history. While the sides remain distant on their respective demands, they've devised a new negotiation framework that involves direct talks between two top Biden aides and an ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Biden is set to travel to Japan for the Group of Seven Summit on Wednesday, but he will cut his overall trip to the Asia-Pacific region short while negotiations continue ahead of the early June deadline to raise the debt ceiling. \"There was an overwhelming consensus I think in today\u2019s meeting with congressional leaders that defaulting on the debt is simply not an option,\" Biden said. It's not clear yet whether Russia will extend its agreement to allow agricultural exports out of Ukraine while the war continues. The pact ends on Thursday. The so-called Black Sea grain deal has ensured the availability of grain and other crops from Ukraine, keeping food inflation in check and ensuring food security for millions. \"When the appropriate decision is made, we will inform you, this is the only thing I can say so far,\" Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's top spokesman, said on Tuesday. Overall, investors are facing a number of headwinds, including rising inflation, interest rates, and the war in Ukraine. This is likely to keep stocks volatile in the near term.\n\nI don't post these types of briefings daily, but I could? If you guys want more posts like this on the daily, be sure to upvote and follow me. It helps me gauge interest.\n\n**Watchlist**\n\n**AAPL** - Got my eyes on AAPL today, weekly bar is trading inside so be mindful of this. If we break below 171.80, this may take us to 171.48, followed by 171.02, then fill some of the gap created below at May 4th to May 5th. we do have a weekly BF sitting at the 171.55~ area so be mindful if we bounce here. A break above 173.14 may take us to 173.84, followed by 174.07, then 174.59; taking out last weeks high.\n\n**MARA** - MARA is coming down to test the 50 daily MA around $8.80 I believe we see this DMA act as support as it did last week. Crypto is still in a bull market.\n\n**AMD** - AMD is coming up to resistance around $101 which is where shares topped out in late March. I believe we see this level reject once again and we get a move lower.\n\n**COF** - Capital One rejected the 50 daily MA twice in early may and now is coming up to test this crucial daily MA once again. Also in mid April the 50 daily MA crossed below the 200 daily MA which implies bearish momentum and should help push shares lower.",

        "selftext": "GM,\n\nTL;DR - Insider buys topped $330 million, largely driven by Warren Buffet\u2019s $125M purchase of Occidental Petroleum ($OXY) on May 11th. Buffet & Berkshire now own 213.8M shares in OXY.\n\nInsider sales rose more than four-fold to $6.2B with $2.7B coming from Constellation Brands. I do expect that the total sales is lower than the reported number due to the way that the Form 4 filings were submitted and the nature of the sales.\n\nThis was a significant week of buying for 10% block owners; excluding Warren Buffet, block owners accounted for $91M in insider buys.\n\n# Notable Buys:\n\n* Warren Buffet + Berkshire Hathaway purchased an additional $125M in Occidental Petroleum ($OXY / Oil & Gas EP) on May 11th, increasing his stake by 1.02%\n* Fred Ehrsam, a Director at Coinbase ($COIN / Financial Data & Stock Exchanges), increased his stake by 72.2% with a $50M purchase on May 9th\n* Viking Global Investors Lp, a 10% Owner of 4D Molecular Therapeutics ($FDMT / Biotechnology), increased their stake by 21.58% in a $13.6M purchase on May 9th\n* Willie Chiang, the Chairman & CEO of Plains Gp Holdings ($PAGP / Oil & Gas Midstream), increased their stake by 41.28% in a $993K purchase on May 8th\n* Kevin Mcnamara, a Director at Tyson Foods ($TSN / Farm Products), increased his stake by 21.54% in a $1M purchase on May 12th\n\n# Notable Sales:\n\n* Several members of a 10% ownership group in Constellation Brands ($STZ / Beverages - Wineries & Distilleries) sold shares. These are registered as separate transactions on $STZ\u2019s Form 4 filings and range from $862M sold to $22K\n* Privia Health Group had $920M+ in insider sales. The 2 largest trades came from Jeffrey Bernstein ($536M on May 8th) and Pamplona Capital Partners ($383M on May 8th)\n* Scott Strazik, an SVP at General Electric ($GE / Specialty Industrial Machinery), decreased his stake by 75.62% in a $17.3M sale on May 10th\n* Eric Green, the President & CEO of West Pharmaceutical Services ($WST / Medical Instruments & Supplies), decreased his stake by 24.64% in a $15.9M sale on May 9th\n* William Foley, the Executive Chairman at Dun & Bradstreet Holdings ($DNB / Financial Data & Stock Exchanges), decreased his stake by 34.42% in a $13.8M sale on May 10th\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases increased from $141M to $333M (+135%)\n* Sales soared from $1.2B to $6.2B (+409%)\n* Transactions dropped by 1 from 843 to 842 (\\~0%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 442 to 476 (+8%)\n   * Net buyers rose from 110 to 125 (+14%)\n   * Net sellers rose from 332 to 351 (+6%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 733 to 739 (+1%)\n   * Net buyers rose slightly from 191 to 193 (+1%)\n   * Net sellers rose slightly from 542 to 546 (+1%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **May 8th - May 12th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.\n2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.\n3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **May 1st - May 5th.**\n4. **No companies without a ticker**\n5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\\*if\\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n## Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n## FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 73%. (Stats as of 2023-04-30)",

Both stocks and bonds experienced a decline amidst this speculation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of 1%, underperforming compared to other major indices. In the bond market, yields across the American curve escalated, with the 30-year note yield reaching approximately 3.9%. This is a level unseen since the period leading up to the financial instability in early March, a situation that followed Pfizer's massive $31 billion debt sale.\n\nPresident Biden initiated discussions with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday, in a sprint against time to establish a budget consensus that could prevent a potential US default. However, the session at the White House was met with signals that negotiations may be at an impasse. There are persistent disagreements regarding the extent and range of compromises necessary for lifting the federal expenditure ceiling.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve official Loretta Mester emphasized that while the central bank doesn't hold the power to influence long-term economic growth directly, it can contribute by regulating prices. Thomas Barkin of Richmond, another Fed official, expressed his continuing doubts about whether inflation has been successfully curbed. Barkin added that he would advocate for additional rate increases if deemed necessary.\n\n**SPY Records Another Limited Trading Day**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sw3jr9d6a0b1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35fc716e7ac87b67a332e85f613bc96b567c1bca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw6gfi4e6a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e8f16f777f12237ec2fc77b9480a0adb206baff\n\n**15 Minute Chart**\n\nThe sellers made their move at 412.72 (62%) and ultimately reached the 5-minute order block, which was in the range of 410.23 to 410.55 or more specifically, 410.41 (-62%). The third target profit was achieved by the end of the day. If you held that long then god bless you degenerate because that was a chop fest until the close. \n\n[from yesterday's post](https://preview.redd.it/ndd8jltm6a0b1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07f8abdc2885e4d0c78a4204432df2a29949b108)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yt32syft6a0b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1058cf379445f40f16dd708e0a2707deb237798\n\nThe day concluded in a similar fashion to the previous one, with the daily chart once again showing an inside day. The market did mirror the lows from yesterday and also registered a high that was lower than yesterday's.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/292lpd4v6a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25770c348eb310397a4eebded552647ddbc1df19\n\n# Tomorrow's Double Reveal: Housing Starts and Building Permits Set to Illuminate Economic Pathways\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, May 17th, two significant economic data releases are scheduled for 8:30 am ET. The first report is on Housing Starts for the month of April. This report measures the number of residential buildings that began construction during the specified period. The Median Forecast for this report is 1.40 million, slightly below the previous figure of 1.42 million. This data provides insights into the health of the real estate market, which is a key indicator of economic activity and consumer confidence.\n\nThe second report scheduled for release at the same time is on Building Permits for April. Building permits are a measure of the number of residential building projects that have been approved by a government authority. The expected figure for this report is 1.43 million, a slight increase from the previous month's total of 1.413 million. The number of building permits is a forward-looking indicator, providing insight into future construction activity and, by extension, potential economic growth.\n\nBoth of these reports are vital as they give us insights into the housing market, a major component of the economy. A rise or fall in these figures can provide insights into broader economic trends, including consumer spending and job growth in the construction sector.\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbrqnhyw6a0b1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15d6a7494d3d569ffde536331cd2b294877d9200\n\n**Daily Chart**\n\nThe significant levels to monitor on the daily chart are today's low at 410.24, identical to the low on May 15th, and today's high at 412.18. Should we break below today's low, we are targeting the lows of May 12th (409.07) and May 5th (408.64), with the hope of starting to fill the 407.77 to 407.27 gap. Keep in mind that we have equal lows at 403.78, which could become critical next week if we manage to escape the current difficult range. A daily closure below 403.78 would prompt us to adopt a longer term bearish outlook, seeking ideal shorting opportunities during any upside retracement on the daily. The bears still have a task ahead of them. As for possible upside, I am merely aiming for a break above today's high of 412.82.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pa1esmry6a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=237566f46ce74fe0085ac09f1d903916f25d8f6f\n\n**15 Minute Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt5o75f17a0b1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8962693115f8f1de677ba1e02f7565b71ecb48ab\n\nThe current market behavior slightly favors the bears, but only marginally, as we're still within a trading range and have experienced an inside day. I typically avoid betting on breakouts, so if the market is indeed trending downwards, it's essential for the bears to demonstrate this with a surge in trading volume and a series of successive bearish days.\n\nTake note of the critical structural break point at 412.33. If a 5-minute candle closes above this level, we should adjust our outlook to bullish and consider entering the market on a dip, with a target of reaching Monday's peak at 413.43.\n\nTomorrow, I'm closely watching the bearish order block between 411.38 - 411.84, which could offer an attractive short-selling opportunity, particularly if the market opens near this range. Here are the sell-side areas I'm keeping in mind for entry, assuming bearish activity persists.\n\nSell-side discounts:\n\n* 410.91 (50%)\n* 411.13 (62%)\n* 411.28 (70%)\n* 411.45 (79%)\n\n*TP represents places to take profit if you took puts at sell side discounts.*\u00a0\n\nDownside targets:\n\n* 409.98 (0%) TP 1\n* 409.48 (-27%) TP 2 (main target, top of bullish order block 409.59 - 408.87)\n* 408.83 (-62%) TP 3\n* 408.12 (100%) TP 4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ntdnf837a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5b5a3e751c637a092e40fccbb45a9a5086ad5a7\n\nIf the market approaches the bullish order block range of 409.59 - 408.87, I'll be observing for either a breakthrough or a reversal pattern on the 5-minute chart. If a reversal does materialize, the main target would be the bearish order block between 411.38 - 411.84.\n\nIf the market penetrates the bullish order block, I plan to refrain from trading actions.\n\nIt's worth noting that I have no intention of buying unless a reversal is observed at the bullish order block or if a candlestick closes above the structural break point of 412.33.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05uq4fw47a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e82e7af39b9ea9abdc5f605f5b42fd8858ee8442\n\nHere is a 15 minute bullish divergence on the RSI\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06v6lcy67a0b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f61b8c9ce06a5a55c8d96c27462ff15130705239",

Excluding automobile sales, retail sales also grew by 0.4%, matching the estimated growth and recovering from a decline of 0.5% in the previous month. When excluding both automobile and gasoline sales, retail sales increased by 0.6%, surpassing the estimated growth of 0.2% and recovering from a decline of 0.5% in the previous month. The control group, which is a significant factor for calculating GDP, experienced a growth of 0.7%, exceeding the estimated growth of 0.3% and recovering from a decline of 0.4% in the previous month. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a55o7sva790b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a57e22dcb911b19f18ce65575ad84b0176fa5dea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ezjlrha790b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89b2ce51991e092ace45ab181601afde0ac77f0c\n\nAs a result of recent hawkish Fed speakers and stronger than expected economic data (sales and also industry output).

Incorporating upward revisions to March retail sales, paired with more weakness n motor vehicle and gasoline sales for April, we raise our real PCE tracking to -1.0% and GDP to +0.2%.\u201d\n\nUS industrial production output unexpectedly beat expectation (both China and EU missed expectation as I mentioned in yesterday's post). \n\nHeadline Industrial Production rose 0.5% MoM in April (up from the 0.5% MoM rise in March and well ahead of the 0.0% change expected). Production of autos & trucks increased 14.5% m/m in April and is near an all-time high. If this continues, the added supply should help bring down car prices, and in turn, help bring down core inflation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r90bi5ooc90b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=40f6ffa2dc88afeb91801803913e5eaca39f58cb\n\nHomebuilder sentiment has returned to a neutral level of 50 after being negative for nearly a year. This improvement is driven by better present sales conditions. It is worth noting that despite mortgage rates (green) not experiencing a significant decline, sentiment in the homebuilding industry has improved throughout 2023.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejtyasi7d90b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1e387ca1aca23aaf312b6a93abb2aab3542b7a5\n\nThe revival of the housing market against all odds is a positive development. The housing market's status as a leading indicator for economic health suggests that this resurgence could be a promising sign for overall economic growth. The improved sentiment among house builders further strengthens this signal, indicating potential economic recovery.\n\nAccording to Zillow's forecast model, U.S. home prices are projected to increase by 4.8% between April 2023 and April 2024. This projection has been revised upward from 1.7% in March, indicating a more optimistic outlook for home prices. However, the forecast also suggests that there will be approximately 4.36 million existing home sales in calendar year 2023, which is 13% fewer than the previous year.\n\nThe schizophrenic trade continues.

The last support to test here would be the black rising wedge support at 409.37 for tomorrow.

With this new supply at 4149 and presumably closing under 4132 demand (support) which is our main range we should look for a move lower tomorrow\u2026 we also are seeing a closure under the daily 8 and 20ema\u2026 \n\nFavoritism would go for a move as low as 4074 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gb5rs6dm990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3853375ace48e4a20740ed88ae025fd80ac8fec3\n\nThere is a very slim chance with this huge recoil here that futes at 5pm could close over 4131\u2026 that would negate some of this breakdown out of the range\u2026 however, presumably I do see it closing below.

He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious\nmistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself.

As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis\".\n\nIn Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.\nHe wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle \ud83d\udd34 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, \"The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate\". In it, he was quoted as saying \"bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully\".\n\nConvinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.\nHe sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98\u2019. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter\ndismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.\nHe eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted \"THIS ISNT FAIR\", that\u2019s his mans, Burry, walked in, \"Honey, your salmon\nis here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.\u201d With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place \ud83c\udfe1.

This is likely to be a long drawn out and protracted war that could see all out war in Sudan. \n\nRight now it's \"impossible.\u201d to source additional gum arabic from rural parts of Sudan because of the turmoil and road blockages, said Mohamad Alnoor, who runs Gum Arabic USA.\n\n\"Depending on how long the conflict continues there may well be ramifications for finished goods on the shelf - branded goods made by household names,\" said Richard Finnegan, a procurement manager at Kerry Group, a supplier of gum arabic to most major food and drink firms.\n\nHe estimates current stockpiles will run out in five to six months.\n\nIt is a view echoed by Martijn Bergkamp, a partner at Dutch supplier FOGA Gum, who estimated between supplies would last for three to six months.\n\nSource: https://news.sky.com/story/sudan-conflict-threatens-supply-of-key-fizzy-drinks-ingredient-12868159\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that could provide similar functionalities to gum arabic in fizzy drinks, but whether they can fully substitute gum arabic in specific drinks like coke would depend on several factors, including the desired taste, texture, and stability of the drink.\n\nCoke, like many other well-established beverage brands, has its own unique formulation and taste profile. The specific blend of ingredients, including gum arabic, contributes to the distinct characteristics of the product. Any substitutions or modifications to the recipe would need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that the desired taste, texture, and stability are maintained.\n\nWhile alternative additives can perform similar functions, there may be differences in terms of their impact on flavor, mouthfeel, and stability compared to gum arabic. It would require extensive testing and formulation adjustments to achieve a suitable substitute while preserving the desired qualities of the beverage. This would be highly expensive and require several new supply lines for $KO to open, and a shortage of supplies of this drink (and others) globally would shock the stock price. \n\nTL;DR - Puts on $KO",

The report cites the UAE's strategic location, its political stability, and its business-friendly environment as key factors that will make it a major financial center in the years to come.\n\nThe UAE is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, making it an ideal location for businesses that want to operate in multiple markets. The country is also politically stable, with a strong rule of law and a commitment to free trade. In addition, the UAE has a business-friendly environment, with low taxes and a streamlined regulatory system.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the UAE has already attracted a number of major financial institutions, including HSBC, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The report predicts that the UAE will continue to grow as a financial center in the years to come, and that it could eventually rival Switzerland as a global hub for finance.\n\nHere are some of the key reasons why the UAE is poised to become the 21st century Switzerland:\n\n* Strategic location: The UAE is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, making it an ideal location for businesses that want to operate in multiple markets.\n* Political stability: The UAE is politically stable, with a strong rule of law and a commitment to free trade.\n* Business-friendly environment: The UAE has a business-friendly environment, with low taxes and a streamlined regulatory system.\n* Attracting major financial institutions: The UAE has already attracted a number of major financial institutions, including HSBC, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs.\n* Potential to rival Switzerland: The report predicts that the UAE could eventually rival Switzerland as a global hub for finance.",

        "selftext": "Famed short-seller Michael Burry loaded up on regional banks during the first quarter, including First Republic before it was bought by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHis hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, snapped up 150,000 shares of the failed lender, worth about $2 million at the end of the first quarter, according to regulatory filings. First Republic\u2019s shares had fallen more than 97% this year before it was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan in a government-brokered deal on May 1.\n\nScion also bought 250,000 shares in PacWest Bancorp, whose stock has slumped almost 79% this year amid the broader turmoil in the sector. The fund acquired 125,000 shares of Western Alliance Bancorp during the quarter. The bank\u2019s stock is down about 48% this year.\n\nBurry also added 850,000 shares of New York Community Bancorp, which has climbed about 20% in 2023 after hitting a year-to-date high earlier this month. Other banks Scion scooped up during the quarter were Capital One Financial Corp. (75,000 shares), Wells Fargo & Co. (125,000 shares) and Huntington Bancshares Inc. (184,900 shares).\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-loaded-bank-stocks-175147923.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-loaded-bank-stocks-175147923.html)\n\nMichael Burry, the money manager made famous in\u00a0*The Big Short,*\u00a0now has a Big Long when it comes to China. He boosted his bullish bets on e-commerce giants JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., even as other hedge funds cooled on the nation\u2019s reopening trades.\u00a0\n\nThe two stocks have become the largest holdings of his Scion Asset Management, accounting for 20% of his stock portfolio. His success relies not only on the companies recovering their mojo but also surviving the geopolitical risks that drove many of his peers away.\u00a0\n\nBurry, who rose to fame after predicting the 2008 housing crash,\u00a0made headlines\u00a0Monday after revealing in a 13F filing that he scooped up regional lenders during the banking turmoil in the first quarter. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat wasn\u2019t his only contrarian bet. After purchasing Alibaba and JD.com in the final months of 2022 as China ended the Covid Zero policy, Burry boosted the holdings of the two last quarter. His stake in JD.com more than tripled to 250,000 shares, worth $11 million, or 11% of his portfolio. He also doubled holdings of Alibaba to $10 million.\n\nFull article: [https://fortune.com/2023/05/16/big-short-investor-michael-burry-betting-big-china-tech-other-hedge-funds-have-cooled-beijing/](https://fortune.com/2023/05/16/big-short-investor-michael-burry-betting-big-china-tech-other-hedge-funds-have-cooled-beijing/)",

        "selftext": "So I thought I'd throw up a post that cannot be argued or debated.  I did check with the WSB bosses before doing this post.  Also, its something that is concrete proof how investors are being screwed. Every day of the week and twice on Sunday. Believe it or not its why I came to reddit - to try and educate people in the ways they are being screwed.\n\nNow I know everyone here is a super duper stock and option trader who is making a KILLING so this is for those who own mutual funds, either in their 401k, 403b, IRA or non-qualified account.\n\nFirst, some factoids:\n\n* The total amount globally in US mutual funds is $27 trillion as of 2021 [Global assets of US-based mutual funds 1998-2021 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255518/mutual-fund-assets-held-by-investment-companies-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=The%20total%20global%20net%20assets,trillion%20U.S.%20dollars%20in%201998.)\n* Total amount in 401ks is $4.8 trillion \\[401(k) Plan Research: FAQs | Investment Company Institute (ici.org)\\]([https://www.ici.org/faqs/faq/401k/faqs\\_401k#:\\~:text=Fund%20assets%20in%20401(k,assets%20industrywide%20(12%20percent).)](https://www.ici.org/faqs/faq/401k/faqs_401k#:~:text=Fund%20assets%20in%20401(k,assets%20industrywide%20(12%20percent).))\n\nHere;s the problem, they SUCK.\n\n**Mutual funds were created with one purpose: to tie up your money in them,** which is then loaned against, borrowed against and lent out. Of course, you see none of those revenues. On top of that, you are charged a management fee. Even with the advent of index funds the average mutual fund management fee is .5% to 1%. Doesn't seem like much until you start compounding it.\n\nAdditionally, 401ks are often stuffed with the worst mutual funds and variable annuities are even worse.\n\nMutual funds are marketed primarily through financial advisors who for the most part wouldnt know a good investment if it kicked them in the nuts or the uterus. Why do they recommend these atrocious wealth destroying vehicles? Commissions, laziness and stupidity. Yes, I said it, most advisors are stuuupid.\n\nIf they are really good sales people they get a front end commission of as high as 5.75%, which they will tell you doesn't come out of your pocket - but thats a lie bc as soon as you buy it, your investment is down 5.75%. Or there are back end fees which often start as high as 5-6%. They only go down the longer you own them.\n\nIt wouldn't matter if the commission was zero and the management fee was zero because mutual funds are still steaming piles of crap.\n\nHere's some proof:\n\n# #1 Percent of funds that outperform their respective benchmarks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xo3dhyxn40b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa124b5b32ab25ee0cce9c8ac7be50c910f3b66c\n\nYes, you are reading those correctly. This kind of shit used to enrage me when I was in the business. And I would constantly get reprimanded for calling them what they are: s h i t.\n\n# #2 But wait, International funds are better!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m25zah0o40b1.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c8a57bd3cc48d20461d7847991d73bdc60681fd1\n\n# #3 Ok, but I KNOW bond funds are better because they are safer!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ecsjzo2o40b1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b87cabee5ffb4a84b4b05b2bd4e43037e7d53871\n\n# #4 Wait, if mutual funds are so bad, how and why are there so many of them? Because the industry uses a classic bait and switch. They close funds and then reopen them under new names with the same managers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26r7zmy4o40b1.png?width=1113&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b48788963ee076742f57b5641a0f830d92d11f0\n\n\\#5 Another trick they do is to change their investment philosophy. They do disclose it to you in 6 font prospectus supplemental that no one reads (well I used to read them just to point out crap like this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i219et6o40b1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2dd7fb392281d95f75384fd5c2ee174268bcb01a\n\nSo you are living your life thinking that you own say a domestic equity fund and now you actually own a small cap global banana fund.\n\nLook, mutual funds are a scam. I cant recommend what you do with yours but lets put it this way, my clients owned ZERO funds. I didnt care about commissions or about the sweet gifts i would get from the mutual fund company. I wouldnt even meet with mutual fund company representatives.\n\nThe WORST of them are funds with names in front of them that rhyme with \"Smells Fargo\" or \"Stank of America\" or pretty much any bank name. Seriously. Any mutual fund is bad.\n\nI DID buy ETFs and index funds sometimes because at least i was going to get like 99.6% of the underlying index's return, but even then, I was also subjecting my client to time risk.\n\nAnyway, consider this a PSA.\n\nI will be curious who could possibly disagree with me on this post.\n\n# Finally, before you get all pissed off about me wussifying the WSB sub with retail drivel like this, I bet your parents or aunts or uncles own these wealth destruction vehicles, if you dont own them yourselves in your 401k. Do them a favor and show them these five slides. Then have them email the slides to their financial advisor or HR benefits person and ask them how they can possible justify recommending these things?? Enjoy the silence.",

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n## Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n## FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons?

The atmosphere was laden with uncertainty as conflicting cues emanated from both factions. In the midst of this, supportive voices from two Federal Reserve dignitaries for deferring rate augmentations breathed fresh life into the tech behemoths.\n\nAdditionally, a positive jolt was felt following the green light from the European Union for Microsoft's ambitious $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. This optimistic wave countered the earlier dip in stocks on Monday, triggered by unsettling revelations that manufacturing in the Empire State plummeted to its lowest ebb since April 2020.\n\n**Inside and Range Day on SPY**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b15agywwh30b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7904335e5104bd6e8d14677b030f8095d0347610\n\n**15 Minute Chart**\n\nThe gap up was faded pre-market at the 413.18 (79%) sell-side discount but Bulls stepped in at 410.27 (50%) buy-side discount and retested 413.16 - 413.63 order block (which they are still putting pressure on AH.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnstzl5vh30b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=609ac208dc927eefefc0d0006bebb93e34806a5a\n\n**1 Hour Chart**\n\nThe SPY recorded a higher low of 410.23 today, up from Friday's low of 409.07. However, it also marked a lower high at 413.50, compared to Friday's pre-market high of 414.27.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76a9mdh0i30b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bcd56de39ad6bfa5370defdd6319e78fc24da046\n\n**Daily Chart**\n\nThree inside days from Wednesday, May 10th.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2pz1gk2i30b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7458715159cf2dc84d8e97b96361ecedd70b56b6\n\n# Retail Revival: Will April's Sales Spring Back as Predicted?\n\n# May 16th Outlook\n\nTomorrow, Tuesday, May 16, promises to be a busy day full of important economic data releases and noteworthy speeches.\n\nThe day kicks off at 8:15 am ET with a speech by Cleveland Fed President Mester. Shortly after, at 8:30 am, the U.S. retail sales report for April is due. The previous month saw a decrease of 1.0%, but this month, it's expected to bounce back with a 0.8% increase. At the same time, we'll see the release of the retail sales data excluding autos, which is forecasted to rebound to 0.4% growth, after a 0.8% decline in the previous period.\n\nIndustrial production for April will be reported at 9:15 am, with expectations pointing towards a slight increase of 0.1%, a slower pace than the previous month's 0.4% growth. Also at 9:15 am, we'll get an update on capacity utilization for April. It's expected to be slightly lower at 79.7%, compared to the previous month's 79.8%.\n\nAt 10:00 am, several events are slated. The March business inventories data will be released, with expectations of no change following a 0.2% increase previously. The Home Builder Confidence Index for May will also be out, and it's expected to stay steady at 45, the same as the previous month. Alongside these data releases, Fed Vice Chair Barr will be testifying.\n\nLater in the morning, at 10:30 am, Richmond Fed President Barkin will give a speech. This will be followed by a speech from New York Fed President Williams at 12:15 pm.\n\nIn the afternoon, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will appear on TV at 2:30 pm. The day will wrap up with a panel discussion featuring Atlanta Fed President Bostic and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee at 7:00 pm.\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrr77uuai30b1.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=333da49f4d561c6a5e3fb047f37f583816478f73\n\n**Daily Chart**\n\nI'm monitoring the level of 413.64 on the daily chart, especially from an optimistic, or bullish, viewpoint. If we break above this level and successfully establish it as a new support, the bulls will likely aim for the high of 414.82 from Tuesday, May 2nd. Additionally, they'll look to fill the gap between 414.77 and 415.27, potentially reaching 417.62 and even 418.31, where there's significant sell-side liquidity. If we can't hold 413.64 as support, then it will likely be a liquidity grab and bull trap.\n\nFrom a pessimistic point of view, we should examine shorter time frames (see 15 minute chart), but daily, breaking today's low of 410.23 could lead us to test the lows of May 12th at 409.07 and May 5th at 408.64, as well as looking to fill the gap between 408.64 and 407.27.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvkfw5uei30b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9964931a3fee8403242a9f45f5227e526943eb6a\n\n**15 Minute Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l1rvgohi30b1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f46697d815619210fc5c1bfbd1f72fb8a9aba308\n\nThe current resistance is in the order block of 413.20 to 413.66. If the price drops below 411.57, it suggests a change in character to bearish. This break could lead to sweeping the higher low at 410.23 and testing the bullish order block from 409.59 to 408.87.\n\nIf we knock out the order block ranging from 413.20 to 413.66, it will create an opportunity to tap into the sell side liquidity at 414.27, 414.56, and 414.89. We can then attempt to fill the gap at 414.77 and 415.27. Closing above 415.27 opens the door to test 416.80 - 417.61 order block.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tcwdixki30b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d4ad4d1f990aec42db3d01d10215c265d8fa1bd\n\nWe saw a big push down near lunchtime at the 413.20 - 413.66 and are currently trading in the sell side-discount zones.\n\nSell-side discounts:\n\n* 412.50 (50%)\n* 412.72 (62%)\n* 412.87 (70%)\n* 413.04 (79%)\n* 413.43 (100%)\n\nIf we can't clear the order block overnight and we open near the current price level, sellers may step in. Here are the downside targets.\n\n*TP represents places to take profit if you took puts at sell side discounts.*\u00a0\n\nDownside targets:\n\n* 411.57 (0%) TP 1\n* 411.07 (-27%) TP 2\n* 410.41 (-62%) TP 3\n* 409.71 (100%) TP 4\n\nThe most favorable target zone to pay attention to is the 5-minute order block spanning from 410.23 to 410.55, which conveniently encompasses the -62% mark. Remember that if we witness a candle closing below 411.57, we ought to adjust our perspective to bearish, regardless of any potential upside retracement we may observe (sell high and buy low).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qpir2wtmi30b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=041cb18d1554e2cc4983b707dd959ff4223e1cc6\n\nHere is a 15 minute bearish divergence that is currently playing out on the RSI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4233aeooi30b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a065dcb994a4ad68141dbdc5177be9ebae1c93ee\n\nIf we find ourselves at the 411.83 - 411.57 5-minute bullish order block tomorrow morning, we will look to see if buyers come in at these buy-side discounts. Note, that these buy-side discounts would be a point of reversal so tread lightly. I would call this order block weak because this low did not take out the 413.33 high and it would be the second test of the order block. Study your reversal patterns.\n\nBuy-side discounts:\n\n* 412.50 (50%)\n* 412.28 (62%)\n* 412.87 (70%)\n* 412.13 (79%)\n* 411.57(100%)\n\nRemember\u2026if we have a candle close below 411.57, we ought to adjust our perspective to bearish, regardless of any potential upside retracement we may observe (sell high and buy low).\n\n*TP represents places to take profit if you took calls at buy side discounts.*\u00a0\n\nUpside targets:\n\n* 413.33 (0%) TP 1\n* 413.94 (-27%) TP 2\n* 414.459 (-62%) TP 3\n* 415.30 (100%) TP 4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg4wroiti30b1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0e72db518f9088c56b8fded231a899033ffc2c4\n\nThanks for reading!

There is still a long distance to go on inflation, we may have to go up on rates. Appropriate policy is to wait and see the effects of tightening to now. There is some risk of recession. If we fall into a recession, it will not be long or deep.\n\nFed's Goolsbee (dovish): A lot of impact of rate hikes is still in the pipeline. It does not feel like a 2008-type of crisis, but it feels like stress in some parts of the financial sector. The effect of banking stress is not small; we need to take it into account and 'sit and watch' it. We are trying to figure out where we are in the business cycle when this cycle looks like no other. May rate hike for me was a close call.\n\nKashkari (hawkish): Labor market is not as frothy as 9 months ago, but still strong overall. Inflation is much much too high, though starting to come down. Fed has more work to do. We should not be fooled by a few months of good data.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Inflation Surprise Index (represents the sum of the difference between official economic results and forecasts) from Citi has fallen to lowest since July 2020\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5rv6lqln20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a21e715e4fa9b95ac59fb9f865ee0dbfb75c2427\n\nAnd more good news on service inflation as we finally start seeing lower occupancy at restaurants and hotels\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afp9jcptn20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7948c55e754b7faf4e3fac321cb4d6f92396f45e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmmg6seun20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0f94c0f029aca70b3e429c316a82a4a63d1437b6\n\nConsumers may still be doing OK, but some signs of weakness has appeared. \n\n[Consumers are trading down on groceries](https://preview.redd.it/emtha9sgo20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86482d8c4989d80e2dfb32b085a4eec6e41c4c32)\n\n[The consumer's financial situation is still robust, but this picture may look very different in the second half of this year.](https://preview.redd.it/t5qi3wuio20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=487b6c68ab159ae0a9c99e8b92ba22bd02f6c92d)\n\n**The Economy**\n\nRegional Fed survey for the month starting again. I will be compiling data here. Stay tuned. \n\nThe NY Fed's May Manufacturing Index declined to -31.8, compared to 10.8 in April. Additionally, the orders index experienced its largest drop since April 2020, reaching the lowest level since the beginning of the year. The shipments gauge plummeted by over 40 points. The current conditions in the NY Empire Manufacturing Index appear bleak. However, the six-month outlook showed improvement. For new orders, current conditions fell to -28.0, the lowest since January, while the six-month outlook jumped to 18, the highest since March 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cliu0djbq20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=406a4e2a7a7c3bd8640b930d1cce786bc56778e4\n\nIndustrial output declining sharply in both EU and China. Eurozone Mar Industrial Output -4.1% on Month (forecast -2.0%); -1.4% on Year (forecast +1.3%) with the biggest decline in computer electronics. China's industrial output also expected to fell 1.3% MoM in April. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cycjhu6uq20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a400232b232db861fcff63ce1544926689209daf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngpo94ruq20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33d0747feb74a3520b3e0b566520dc2db059e4fd\n\n**The Business**  \nThe NASDAQ (blue) continues to trend higher, but the percentage of members trading above the 200-day moving average (orange) has not shown any significant progress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozch3qc2r20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35a69bc1647e2a7a1d5736ccb384f05f9d85b779\n\nAccording to GS, analysts' (bottom-up) estimations have rebounded slightly but have largely stabilized. As we approach the halfway point of the year, estimations typically align closely with eventual actuals. The 1Q 2023 earnings season turned out to be much better than anticipated. Margins in every sector exceeded expectations, leading them to believe that the worst of the negative earnings revision cycle for 2023 is now in the past.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4g4ebebr20b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d9e0d6a65767e748355642334ace6d5d9d534b2\n\nI still couldn't figure out how the Q4 10%  yoy earnings growth will materialize, and it seems CITI analysts couldn't either.

With that it could be an indication that we are going to push to the upside. However, if you look at the daily price action you can see we are clearly still in a range and realistically what most probably is going to happen is we continue to push these support/ resistance lines out until we finally see a sustainable breakout or breakdown. \n\nWe are attempting and realistically establishing 411.6 as a major support area now. The major resistance still lies in that 413.4 to 414.7 area though. \n\nAs long as SPY continues to close candles over the daily 8ema I am neutral to bullish\u2026 as I said last week I do believe it is still too early to short\u2026\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  \n Demand- 411.6 -> 405  \n Support- 411.6 -> 408.8  \n Resistance- 413.5 -> 414.7 -> 415.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eefi3pa6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f225a5138c02de28370124ce206d3d0be7afd1ca\n\nFutures and SPY are now back on track together with Futes also putting in a new demand (Support). With todays new demand at 4131 it actually lowers the current demand from 4134 (takes it out) to the current 4131. \n\nSupport being established at 4131 means we start to look at the next supply (resistance) which sits at 4153 then 4190. If you remember from Friday that supply was re-confirmed (hence the dashed line instead of normal solid) which means we should look at 4153 as a major resistance area. \n\nIt is probable that we do reject here but also the biggest thing to note is that the last 7 candles have no closed within this 4131 to 4153 range\u2026 \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uoszv3r6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7714c13b8df914b84f1ce3653bf4da8be68fa6d\n\nPrice action wise with this really nice double bottom off 4131 and establishing a new demand (support) I would definitely look for the upside here.. it should be noted that we still have not broken through that blue resistance line which has 4 touches on it\u2026 that resistance sits at 4155 for tomorrow and that is what we will call our line in our sand\u2026\n\nA wick through 4155 but more importantly a closure OVER 4153 tomorrow would indicate the potential for a bigger move up to that 4190 to 4198 area. \n\nHowever, if we truly are range bound there actually is a high probability that we reject tomorrow with a double top off 4150 and close somewhere near 4130-4135. IF this happens we actually are likely to see a new supply (resistance) established below 4153. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4153 -> 4190  \n Demand- 4131 -> 4074  \n Support- 4131 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4153 -> 4180\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpw54f87i20b1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b087f7e1e7ab75c9fe9c2e38a6d7ec9a1fe217f9\n\nInterestingly enough\u2026 the VIX actually closed green today AND SPY closed green\u2026 actually even more interestingly is that the VIX closed a 0.29%+ and futures closed at exactly 0.29%+\u2026 I actually do not know if I have ever seen that happen before\u2026\n\nThe VIX this morning was up about 3-4% before it finally started to sell off\u2026 it attempted to break through that 17.72 resistance level, however, once again failed and ended up coming back to that key 17.1 support area. \n\nThe VIX continues to be sandwiched in that 16.79 to 17.72 area with the mean reversion being to 17.1 area. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsj31r88i20b1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97277e62d2d7224281ad40d2b06a7271f0b1326b\n\nReally couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to start the week off\u2026 pulled in 75% of my weekly goal today. \n\nWhile these extremely tight ranges\u2026 where spy closes within a 30-50 cent range for 2 hours or more\u2026 are extremely annoying and I would much rather play a bigger range, I have truly finally been able to capitalize on these movements. \n\nThe one thing that I will always love about SPY is that it is predictable, chartable, and tradeable in all conditions\u2026 2022 challenged me to be a better trader and to adapt to the ever changing market and volatility\u2026 so far in 2023 we are now learning how to be better range traders\u2026 2022 and 2023 have been learning experiences that any of us who survive will use as tools to be better traders and prosper for the rest of our trading careers.",

        "selftext": "Had a lot of questions about how OIL is being used to compress the VIX.  I will attempt to explain in terms I understand.  DM me if you want a technical explanation and I will send you over to TWTR.\n\nThesis: Oil is one of the tools being used intraday to compress the VIX.  Central banks use various oil contracts intraday to control the VIX (but its only one tool; others are USD and the new VIX ETFs - SVIX, UVIX, etc. and the 1dte VIX options).\n\nI am not a graphic designer so excuse the simplicity of the following but I like to keeps things simple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hswp3wamm10b1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48cd6b29bbecd7bf5ad37bc24130c67cdc610118\n\n# Suppress Oil and suppress VIX - easy to see.\n\n# In the above its easy to see why Oil is so important.\n\n* If the Fed wants to support the market, it must lower inflation.\n* To lower inflation, it must keep oil low.\n* If it can keep Oil low, inflation stays low, interest rates stay low, the VIX stays low and the market goes up.\n\n# The Fed has a problem:\n\n* Inflation has been rising, and I dont care what the Fed says because I see it food prices, mortgage rates, everything.\n* Rates have been RISING.\n* The way to lower inflation is for the Fed to PULL money out of the system.\n* BUT THE FED HAS BEEN INJECTING LIQUIDTY TO PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF BANKS.  This is seen by the growth of the Fed's balance sheet:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz11l2i4i10b1.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=823752471fdc609d08430af4c513b353f47e6120\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet grows when among other things, they lend more money to banks via the Discount Window.  They can do other things but this is the primary way.\n\nHere's the problem and its simple supply and demand:\n\n# When there are more dollars (liquidity) chasing the same amount of product, the prices of the products rise (inflation).\n\n# THEREFORE: the Fed should be pulling liquidity not adding if they are worried about inflation.  But they are not.  Why?????\n\nThese are the reasons:\n\n1. If they pull liquidity then banks balance sheets will worsen and more banks will fail.\n2. If more banks fail, then economies and countries will worsen.  Credit Suisse??\n3. If countries fail, then the US has much less control over how those countries behave.\n4. And if countries and banks fail, then the bankers behind both make a lot less money, or in some countries, they go to jail.\n5. If bankers go to jail, politicians at the very least dont get reelected and at worse, they die.\n\n# Ok, so now that we have the relationships and the possible outcomes, how does the Fed monkey hammer the oil market down???\n\n**First, look at this chart.  The purple is the VIX.  The bars are oil.  Here's the last couple of months.  When Oil goes down, VIX for some reason goes down.  Pretty easy to see.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wng8og3xo10b1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc794c173109e8265081bfaae55e61f01000d907\n\nIf the VIX goes up:\n\n* Rates go up = BAD\n* Market goes down = BADDER\n\n# HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS?\n\n1. Well the release from the SPR helped but there is only so much oil in SPR.\n2. Through the oil futures market\n3. Through the oil options market\n4. Through the oil spot prices\n5. With help from its friends Japan, Europe, the devil (JPM), etc. <--- they also use #2-4 to assist.\n\nThere you go.  An oversimplified explanation how oil is being used to suppress the VIX and why keeping the VIX low is so important.\n\nOf course, as I shared, the Fed has many more tools to compress the VIX which supports the market.\n\n* The Fed ~~can print more money~~  **can pull liquidity (CORRECTED - thankyou** u/animalturds**)**  from the system which has the effect of lowering interest rates which is deflationary. Less dollars chasing the same products forces the product prices down.\n* The Fed can lend less money to banks - WAIT, NO THEY CANT BC THE BANKS WILL FAIL.  HAHAHA - Fed is stuck.\n* The Fed can let the VIX rise and let the market fall, which is very devaluing.  NOPE, CANNOT DO THIS BC BANKS WILL FAIL.\n\nThe Fed is playing whack a mole - my bet is that sooner than later they fail.\n\n# Bottomline: The Fed is stuck between supporting our economy, THEIR JOB, and saving banks that shouldn't have been saved in 2008 - $CS et al.  They are trying to do both but at the end of the day, they know if they let more BIG banks fail, then everything gets much worse.  Remember that Credit Suisse has $17 Trillion in derivatives.  If they fail, game over.\n\n***FINAL: I havent been able to answer all the comments from my last post.  If you still want to dialogue or tell me how stupid I am, please DM me.***",

        "selftext": "There's this article from a few months ago.\n\n\nhttps://www.mining-technology.com/news/tesla-sigma-lithium/\n\nOnly a few countries have large reserves of lithium like Australia and Chile. \n\nChile is going to Nationalise it's lithium mining industry and only allows a few companies to operate there one being from the US Albemarle. This video on YouTube is interesting \n\nhttps://youtu.be/HSh6EgMwMOY\n\nThey recently opened up licencing and China is going to mine there too. \n\nThere's only limited supplies of lithium and seeing as a smart phone only uses a few hundred grams of lithium in a battery and a EV uses about 40kg to 60kg per vehicle you can see that lithium is going to be in very short supply. China is the world's largest EV market so they'll devour as much of it as possible and aquire mines and resources for the EV market so also NIO will likely see a massive boost in value too in the coming years, the EV market grew 40 percent there last year and the Chinese can build the infrastructure nationally very quickly to support it... Not to mention their ramping up of renewable energy that requires lithium battery storage. Countries and organisations will start resource guarding lithium to ensure the viability of their companies and renewable energy growth especially as China controls at least two-thirds of the world's lithium processing capacity currently and could set an internal and export price of both lithium and their manufacturing of Lithium Ion batteries accounting for 80 percent of current production, their mining in in Africa will also account for a large percentage of the world's in 5 to 10 years. China will control renewable as well as the EV market in the coming decade and the west will have to pander to them unless they resource guard the resource themselves driving up prices. The west will be stuck between fossil fuels with OPEC or pandering politically to China if the wish to ramp up renewable energy or the EV market and supply chain for both. If lithium was listed as a commodity on the stock market in the same way as gold then this may change the control and shift the dynamics away from China. Either way China has a strong foothold... In the long term Sodium Ion batteries are cheaper compared to lithium but don't perform as well so there will always be a market in technology and EV for lithium Ion batteries, Sodium Ion batteries could be good for large scale power storage where size isn't something to worry about. I can also actually see things like driverless cars fueling the EV market adoption massively so long as companies like uber cut out services like Uber Black. \n\nIt would make sense an acquisition could follow for Tesla if they want to secure their world status.\n\n\nEdit: seems there's a risk to  manufacturing of Electric vehicles in the EU and UK due to sourcing of materials.\n\nUnless they alter things the majority will be imports from the US and China\n\nBBC News - Rishi Sunak talking to EU over threat to UK electric cars\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65631167\n\nNonsensical to have these laws when the infrastructure isn't in place so it will crush the EV manufacturing industry in Europe. This could also harm tesla manufacturing in Europe unless they had their own lithium mine and refining. If countries don't regulate and ensure stability companies will increasingly arrange their own supply chain outside of the system.",

        "selftext": "I've been reading their balance sheets to see similarities and differences between the failed FRC bank and some of the ones still in the game: PACW, ZION, and WAL.\n\nFirst, here are the balance sheets I've been looking at:\n\n[https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a)\n\n[https://s21.q4cdn.com/920996046/files/doc\\_financials/2023/q1/Press-Release-3-31-2023-Final.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/920996046/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Press-Release-3-31-2023-Final.pdf)\n\n[https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-2023/default.aspx](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-2023/default.aspx)\n\n[https://zionsbancorporation.com/financial-info/as-reported-financial-statements/default.aspx](https://zionsbancorporation.com/financial-info/as-reported-financial-statements/default.aspx)\n\nThe first major difference I found is that **FRC had a massive 31b in held-to-maturity securities**. This category is special, because it allows banks to have massive unrealized losses without declaring it. By comparison, they had 18b in shareholder equity. So while they claimed their book value was $76 a share....that was BS. Also, there is a limit to how much banks can sell from their \"held-to-maturity\" category before they are seen as non-compliant.\n\nHere's a comparison (I highly suggest you see the balance sheets yourself for more accurate figs):\n\n*Bank - Cash - HTM secs - Equity - Total Assets*\n\n*FRC - 13b - 31b - 18b - 323b*\n\n*PACW - 6b - 2b - 2.7b\\*\\* - 44b*\n\n*ZION - 705m - 592m - 7.3b - 69b (nice)*\n\n*WAL - 3.6b - 1.3b - 5.5b - 71b*\n\n*\\*\\* PACW actually already includes their unrealized losses as part of this figure. So by comparison to other banks in this figure, they have 3b+ in equity.*\n\nSo as you can see, by this metric there is quite a big difference between the failed FRB bank and the others. Much lower HTM secs, which result in more accurate book values. These banks aren't perfect, since they do have a good chunk of unrealized losses, but at least its not under HTM.\n\nThe other major difference I've found is of course, the percentage of uninsured deposits which I'm sure many of you already know. **FRC had only \\~33% insured deposits**. Meanwhile, the other banks on the list have plenty of coverage for their uninsured deposits.\n\nFrom what I've found on coverage for uninsured deposits:\n\nPACW - 153% coverage, 73% insured\n\nWAL - 158%, 73% insured\n\nZION - \\~100%? (they don't specify, they just say they have \"enough\"). 45% insured deposits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position:\n\nI had PACW, WAL, and ZION. I sold all PACW and WAL but bought PACWP and WAL-PRA, because I prefer the risk & reward there better, but still relies on banks surviving or liquidating with equity leftover.\n\nI had ZION but I sold it as I was writing this DD after realizing they had 55% uninsured.\n\nCurrently:\n\n5000 shares of PACWP\n\n2000 shares of WAL-PRA\n\nOn two separate accounts for a total of 10k and 4k shares (\\~$150k), respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:Banks still risky but market might be too fearful.\n\nLet me know if I made a mistake above. Mainly posting this to see if you guys have some other banks you'd like me to look into. Let me know in the comments and I will DD them. Give me a nice flair if this goes well.",

The major indices continued to grind sideways/slightly upwards this week. This week we have jobless claims coming out at 8:30 am on Thursday and Jerome Powell speaking on Friday at 11:00 am. There are also some notable earnings reports this week such as Home Depot, Walmart, and Cisco, among others.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qr1pe08mwvza1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d93478d85601b2aba297c05da13f48702484eed4\n\nSPY has been trading in a range bound pattern since the beginning of April. A positive is that price is currently sitting above the 50 day (green) and 200 day (white) [exponential moving average ](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/)(EMA). For the smaller time frame EMAs, price has been fluctuating above and below. Range bound action can be difficult to trade since the exit signals are not always apparent. In a downward trending market, the signs to get out of a position are usually alot clearer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9nz0bnomwvza1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74f7ba57ee20773e8ba8268bf11768b61263b514\n\nQQQ is behaving slightly better, indicating that we should focus on Tech/NASDAQ stocks. There is a clear upwards trend in the price actions and EMAs of QQQ. Although it would be nice for the pullbacks in price to be better supported by the 8 day (red) and 21 day (orange) EMA. Price can still whip back and forth considerably even though the overall trend is upward. Both SPY and QQQ are still telling us to be cautious, yet optimistic, in the market.\n\n**ETFs To Watch**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b25ya48nwvza1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98d2c2416e19b170c41cfa52199c1627e9dd1514\n\nFDN is an ETF that tracks the largest and most liquid US Internet companies. There are several bases in this chart of varying lengths. The price action is constructive now that the current price sits above the 50 day and 200 day EMA. There was also some volume that came in on Friday and further support the price. If the markets start to advance there could be several buy opportunities as well as add on purchases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ducnrtnwvza1.png?width=2276&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=674e9ea97393f043bd730feb76e573adb62b16ce\n\nGLD is an ETF that tracks the spot price of gold. GLD has a long weekly base that it approached 2 weeks ago but then sold off. This would be a good buy if there are continuing issues with banking sector. This could be an extremely powerful moving given how long the base is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9a5spfowvza1.png?width=2267&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa50cec514f8699f57cbfa1f39fe06430cd158d\n\nXHB is an ETF that tracks U.S. home builders. This industry has had some good moves recently and this ETF is currently setting up nicely. It is forming a long base breakout and has price sitting above the moving averages.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnbwagyowvza1.png?width=2256&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=507649a6f29c0d556d02437ee2c77e872024b376\n\nXLC is a communications ETF with major holdings in META and GOOGL. It formed a cup with low handle several weeks ago and is currently approaching yearly highs. This ETF is being carried by bigs moves from GOOGL and META, so if those stocks move big this is going to do so as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5v15qnpwvza1.png?width=2277&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7635b95512f9cb36a72f4c713d88cc2f568b8a1\n\nXLP tracks the consumer staples stocks and has formed a very long weekly base. Consumer staples are sometimes slower moving stocks and that is reflected in the ETF as well. There are some big names in this ETF such as PG, KO, COST, and PEP.\n\nFor all of the ETFs shown, it is a good idea to look at the top holdings and examine the charts of individual names. This may lead to better setups and faster moves than what can be reflected in the ETFs.\n\nAs always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment.\n\nIf you have any comments or question on what is discussed in the article or otherwise please feel free to reach out!",

This was the smallest annual increase since April 2021 and the 10th straight month of improvement since inflation peaked in June of last year at 9.1%. Core inflation ticked down to 5.5% from 5.6%. While core inflation simply met expectations, the price increase was partly driven by a spike in used car prices. However, wholesale used car price dropped in April, so this decline may be reflected in retail price in May or June. Housing likely to decline as well given Fed\u2019s lagging statistic method. What\u2019s even more encouraging is the core services inflation excluding shelter (the so called \u201csuper core\u201d which is largely a function of the labor market), improved meaningfully, rising by the slowest pace in nine months. Labor market, even though still very tight, showed sign of weakness as initial jobless claim jumped to a 1-year high. Below is the summary from this week\u2019s news.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qev76jh0duza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c100cb399891fc173932aa006d2641c9a53b505\n\n[Summary from previous weeks](https://preview.redd.it/c4632qn1duza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42b2bd17be52a5dbd048d6b93e830ff7f9a5c2b7)\n\n[Now that Fed rate is officially higher than CPI, a pause is reasonable](https://preview.redd.it/5e0pl809duza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d216c565b8a587f54f99e644ab9bccb32437e85c)\n\n**Both lending condition and demand deteriorated, and small business sentiment dropped to a new low.** SLOOS report released on Monday showed an incrementally tighter lending condition vs. Jan survey. However, loan demand also declined, especially in the CRE sector where buyer had the worst contraction in CRE loan demand in recent years. The reason for low loan demand included hard to get funding, cost of funding is high, low confidence in the economy (no interest in expanding or buying large assets). If credit condition tightening continues, it could be a recipe for recession, however, recent data showed lending actually improved in both large and small banks. Regional bank also suggested that they will continue to expand credit this year in their earnings calls. Plus, if loan demand is so low, losing some deposit might not be a bad thing (or even desired) as cash deposit is a liability for banks.  So what\u2019s concerning is not lending standard but rather loan demand, which a net 55.6% of domestic banks reported declining C&I loan demand from large and medium-sized businesses, comparable to the levels we last saw during the GFC.\n\n[Historically, when lending condition tightens sharply, hard landing follows](https://preview.redd.it/93650phgduza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=020957a1a6cb2fe4d26aad5ae67b3b1a0fda1460)\n\n[Bank lending has been growing for the last few weeks for both large and small banks](https://preview.redd.it/injgs0ynduza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=17af01ec4ba3ebab11301d019eb95bfbfabc52af)\n\nSmall business optimism index hit a new low in almost 2 decades mostly due to soft measures (expectations) such as expected sales and earnings as well as inventory; hard measures (current condition) on the other hand is still steady such as current job opening and credit condition.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7n0m2c6euza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c6a01bed09524d72cce0cca5e2df0b431eb83862\n\n**Q1 earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectation however companies experienced smaller-than-average price increases.** With 92% of S&P 500 companies having reported first-quarter results as of Friday, the proportion of S&P 500 companies that have beaten analysts\u2019 earnings expectations remained slightly higher than usual. So far, 78% of companies have exceeded net income expectations, topping the 10-year average of 73%. On the other hand, companies reporting negative surprises faced larger price declines than usual. Overall, 46% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported a positive EPS surprise for Q1 have seen a decrease in price two days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings release while companies that have reported negative EPS surprises have seen a larger price decrease than average (4.1% vs. 2.2%). This market response cannot be solely attributed to the earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2023, as companies providing guidance have been less negative compared to previous averages. About 57% of S&P 500 companies issued negative guidance for Q2 2023, below historical averages. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dzrv939euza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=41fd471fcb073cd66e7f6d367e47ceadce3058ce\n\n**Regional bank issue persists and could get worse.** The acquisition of First Republic Bank's assets by JPMorgan Chase did not improve the performance of U.S. bank equities. Since the deal was announced on May 1, the S&P 500 Regional Banks Index has declined by almost six percent. Hedge funds, concerned about First Republic's issues and the lack of temporary deposit guarantees by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have been searching for other regional banks that may face similar problems. This has led to short selling and added pressure on bank stocks, particularly those vulnerable to deposit outflows. Additionally, the tightening of lending standards by banks due to weak economic trends has compounded the challenges. Although federal financial authorities have the means to address potential issues, negative news about specific regional banks is likely to continue weighing on bank stocks and could impact broader market indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qogc46feeuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98ca5c5f930b77285d8f77aa5ca13ca5ddee05c2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b75o6l0feuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=447d4729735fc8f64ca413a0040c4c6f85aabf7a\n\n**The debt ceiling drama could get out of hands.** I still don\u2019t believe US will default (never happened before), but that doesn\u2019t mean the debt ceiling drama won\u2019t create any volatility in the market. According to a study by RBC Capital Markets, the impact of debt ceiling deadlines on the S&P 500 varies based on market conditions and political factors. During calm periods with low volatility and minimal political risks, S&P 500 declines related to debt ceiling deadlines were modest, ranging from 2% to 7%. However, when the market was already anxious due to economic concerns and there was heightened political drama surrounding the debt ceiling, the market struggled, leading to declines of 10 percent to 19 percent. The most severe instance occurred in 2011, when the S&P 500 dropped 19 percent during a political clash in Washington over the debt ceiling. This nearly resulted in a crisis and the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating, compounded by fears related to the European sovereign debt crisis. I would say today\u2019s market condition is getting closer and closer to a bad scenario.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbzyjioieuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2d7d9493a5e782fd928654a1a4403a684e758e0\n\n# My positions and predictions\n\n**US Equity Valuation**\n\nAfter this week\u2019s earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:\n\n2023 Full Year EPS: $221\n\nNTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)\n\n2024 Full Year EPS: $247\n\nCurrent forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. In terms of valuation, we unchanged from last week (18.0).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kjnk3lneuza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=069334590d7c328d743f42897ee2e0472eb1dd74\n\nMy investment thesis has not changed. Stock price is too high due to low risk premium:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy5or7zoeuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d81132ba5aa4db0402298c27a9ff2a67f75ba4b\n\nIf we valuate SP500 based on risk premium (10-year average at 3%), stock today should have a forward PE of 15.4, and given NTM EPS is $230 and 2024 EPS is $247, SPX should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year end (might be higher since T-bill yield is probably lower at year end).\n\nHeadwinds and Tailwinds based on this week\u2019s data\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ews8jp1veuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=836e5518534b85c95b2cd6dd370c95c2dd234efa\n\nI want to add a quick word on earnings. Q1 earnings have largely beaten expectations; however, overall, S&P 500 earnings are still 4.5% lower than Q1 of last year. Currently, analysts' estimate for 2023 full-year earnings remains the same or slightly higher than last year, primarily due to an anticipated 10% year-over-year earnings growth in Q4. In my opinion, this projection is overly optimistic. How can we expect a 10% earnings growth when inflation is only estimated to be 3.5%, while we are experiencing negative growth with inflation at 6-7%? This simply doesn't make any sense to me. I am still incorporating analysts' estimations into my model, but when I say we are priced for perfection, you can understand what I mean. Some analysts share my view, and below is an earnings estimation from PIMCO.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ulffv16fuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ad207c1f570f5894d8060d04a676f101587e7a08\n\n**My year-end projection (not changed):**\n\nMy base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.\n\nLight blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk2yim68fuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d74e8e77fdbcf1a9776dc7178ffd0aad23e3455d\n\nIf the current \"Goldilocks\" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small- and mid-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small /Mid Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity. These stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with low interest rates. But obviously sell everything when sign of recession appears. \n\n[Small Cap valuation is attractive but only if we can have a soft landing](https://preview.redd.it/wl7tt07afuza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f88b1702e53cbd6ff35ff050404cd6814ecf47a)\n\n[Growth has been beating value since this year](https://preview.redd.it/z1q5pdwafuza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f417cc47f9b2d6190609bb811bb984e54b96cbc1)\n\n[U.S. equity size and style total returns as of 5\\/12\\/23 \\(&#37;\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4re1t8rgfuza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bf69a68a3d20444f896c40928e9ca748125e8e7)\n\nI continue to overweight bonds over equities due to the tremendous amount of uncertainty that lies ahead of us.\n\n[Bonds overall performs better than equity after Fed pauses\\/pivots; however past performance is no guarantee of future results](https://preview.redd.it/4e540ismfuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b35c42b9fbf2a345ec7fb0de8c1f7a3134692ba7)\n\n**My positions have not changed.**\n\nSPY 6/15 400 Put\n\nIWM 6/15 165 Put\n\nTLT Jan 2024 110/115 leap call spreads\n\nDDOG Jan 2024 100 call\n\nZS Jan 2024 130 call\n\n**I am doing some DD on small growth stocks and hope to share with you soon.

I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.\n\nI am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.\n\n# When will this tight range end?\n\nWay back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.\n\nWhats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.\n\nA couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):\n\n1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.\n2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)\n3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.\n\nI have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.\n\n# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?\n\nSo a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.\n\nHere is what has happened recently:\n\n# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:\n\n1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.\n   1.

Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.\n\n# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:\n\n1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.\n2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.\n3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired.

Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.\n\n# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%).

They use past performance to predict today's prices, like trying to find the perfect lipstick \ud83d\udc84 by looking at last season's colors.\n\nWhat I do is spice things up \ud83d\udd25! I start with the current option open interest and whizz it into portfolio-level greeks (Delta & Gamma are *so* in vogue right now). Then, I simulate the change in greeks at different price points to find the *high-fashion* levels, where gamma is at its peak and delta is barely noticeable.

Lower conviction? Oh, darling, just allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% and strut that dollar-cost average!\n* The trades were calculated pre-market open so they're *so* yesterday.

Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.\n\n1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.\n2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.\n3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.\n4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",

        "selftext": "tldr: \\~$3.7/share floor assuming they keep all the insured depositors but could still dip below that (and did on May 4th) and you could get FDICked\n\n# Background\n\nOn the afternoon of April 28th I was pondering how my cheap FRC 65C 5/19 purchased a week before could have gone so wrong when I remembered something from listening to the entire audiobook of Security Analysis (1934): Companies are valuable by assets they have or profits they can generate. An asset-rich but unprofitable company can potentially be turned around, or liquidated at a profit if share price falls low enough. An asset-poor but profitable (or soon to be profitable) company will become wealthier as long as dividends are not too high. FRC was a puddle of toxic financial waste that was losing money every quarter from assets that were net negative in value (deposit / asset mismatch) and the FDIC had to fill in 13 billion for JPM to take the deal. The earnings that came out on the 24th made it very clear there was no way to get some kind of positive value out of the company for anyone. I bought 1P 5/19 at 45 cents, which sold the next week after receivership for 80 cents and made me slightly positive on the whole ordeal.\n\nPACW is a regional bank in a precarious state. They are next in line after FRC in terms of sentiment, stock price collapse, and news of deposits fleeing. They are [drawn in to Burry's chart in scary red letters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub295/michael_burrys_chart_for_banks_with_regard_to/) which is obviously very bearish too. However, they are in at the 60% uninsured deposit / 35% unrealized CET1 losses zone which is far lower than (redacted <500M bank), Silvergate, and First Republic. Regional banks are now literal reverse meme stocks where volatility and sentiment can cause the deposit outflows that cause asset-liability mismatch and kill the bank's profitability or even solvency. PACW's 2031 bond is 40 cents on the dollar, showing severe lack of confidence in their survival. Without a surprise injection of capital or sudden rate cut, their outlook is gloomy until enough of their loans renew at a higher rate and/or rates go down enough to take pressure off their interest margin, probably sometime in or after 4Q 2023. They are also trying to sell their Lender Finance arm for 2.7B but it seems to be taking a while to close. The common dividend was cut last week from 25 cents to 1 cent, which was actually pretty well received on Monday, but the effect didn't last, and the dividend was announced late on Friday night. They announced they were looking at \"strategic options\" which seemed to have a mostly downward effect as they're clearly looking but haven't made a deal. They are certainly still a solvent bank, but how much should the stock be worth, and what happens if more deposits leave?\n\n# Analysis\n\nPACW is still generating a profit from their deposits, but it has shrunk as deposits left and interest rates rose. Another lesson from Security Analysis is to remember who gets paid and in what order: bonds, preferred shares, common stock. Usually companies are either profitable and everyone gets paid or fail and the bond holders fight over the scraps, but sometimes it can land in the middle. I'm going to focus on the common stock. Here is the current situation from yesterday's 10Q:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Description|Value|Note|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q1 2023 earnings available to common|80 million|In the 10Q they have some goodwill impairment thing going on that makes Q1 look like a massive loss, this is after ignoring that and some layoff costs.|\n|Q1 2023 earnings for common annualized|320 million||\n|Number of common shares|123 million|200M authorized|\n|Price at 10x earnings for Q1 2023|3.2B, or $26/share|The stock was around $27/share in February|\n||||\n|Mar 31 Net Interest Margin|2.89%|This is the majority of their revenue. The margin drops as they lose low-cost deposits. Down from 3.43.|\n|Mar 31 deposits|28 billion|Down 5.7 billion (16.9% in Q1)|\n|Mar 31 uninsured deposit %|29%|Down from 52% on Dec 31|\n|Mar 31 uninsured deposits|8.12 billion||\n||||\n|May 4-5 deposit drop|Down 9.5%|Holy shit bro they lost 10% in 24 hours. tbh I'd leave if I was uninsured too.|\n|May 10 uninsured deposits|5.2 billion|Losing 9.5% of 28B entirely from 8.12B uninsured would be 5.46B remaining, but they probably lost some in April too so the numbers aren't exact|\n|May 10 immediate liquidity|15 billion|If the rest of the uninsured deposits panic they can cover it at least, although it means more asset-liability mismatch|\n|Deposits if all uninsured leave|20.12 billion|Mar 31 - 9.5% - 5.2B|\n|Reduction in deposits times reduced NIM|\\-229 million|(28-20.12)\\*-0.029. This is the loss to yearly revenue from yield on deposits.|\n|Earnings for common with above reduction|91 million or 22.75 million per quarter|Worth nothing this is 18.5 cents per share quarterly. That 25c dividend isn't coming back.|\n|**Price at 10x earnings**|**910M, or $7.4/share**|**This is around the recent peak. This would be what the price would stabilize to after a few months.**|\n|**Price at 5x earnings**|**455M, or $3.7/share**|**I found some old paper that said during the GFC banks were valued at more like 5x earnings. This is also the recent low.**|\n||||\n|Insured deposit outflow required to wipe out common earnings|\\-3.5B or remaining insured deposits 16.62B|Assuming all uninsured deposits also leave. It is the remaining earnings for common 91M divided by 0.026 (a reduced NIM).|\n|% Drop from current estimated 25B deposits to wipe out common earnings|\\-33.5%|Basically, if they lose another 1/3 of deposits the stock is only worth the possibility of future recovery.|\n||||\n\nKind of freaked me out that the analysis came out close to the recent high for the optimistic case and recent low for the cautious case. It's all priced in???. I decided to focus on the earnings available to common since that's where the option plays and massive swings are. The preferred stock is paying a 20% dividend if that's your thing, but know that if they lose profitability on the common the preferred follows very soon after.\n\nGraham and Dodd would tell you to seriously consider the bonds or preferred shares too since they get paid first and a near-certain 40% is much better than an unlikely 3x. I don't have access to good bond data so I would appreciate if someone can explain why their bonds are trading at 40 cents.\n\nFor the common stock, Graham and Dodd would insist on a considerable margin of safety for any purchase. Probably in the $2 - $2.7 per share range, if at all with the risk of further deposit flight and receivership. They would probably also look at other regional banks like WAL that are in the crosshairs but have stronger positions and leave PACW alone until their future became more certain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI have seen generally bearish sentiment about PACW as bullish as the general sentiment about FRC the week before earnings, in some cases even switching to being a PACW bear to make up for FRC losses (wrong inverse dummies, the weaker banks fail first). So I do expect some loss porn with short strike puts as well as some overly optimistic calls. Also, if PACW falls below $4.06/share (500M mkt cap) then we will not be able to discuss it anymore lmao.\n\nThere seems to be a mismatch in that there is still a demand for loans from these regional banks but not enough interest in deposits to fund those loans. The model of 5 - 30 years loans but deposits that can leave anytime doesn't work with rates rising this fast. That could mean a massive liquidity crunch in real estate loans but that's another topic entirely and maybe even wouldn't be a bad thing long term if it corrects commercial / multifamily RE prices.\n\nThe risk and amount (per share) of potential loss is significantly less with a low entry point, so perhaps sell CSP at $3 or below. All things considered, this is a very borderline bank and its survival basically hinges on the insured depositors sticking around, very slow rate hikes or a rate cut, and no further major unrealized losses to the assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nMy positions: I am holding a \"don't know shit about fuck\" spread. Only started with options last week so positions are small until my hubris grows. IBKR is on maintenance or something so no screenshots, but here it is from memory.\n\n|PACW 100 shares @ 6.1 purchased May 10.|\n|:-|\n|Short 8C Jan15 2025 @ 2.98 sold May 10 (buy write with the shares).|\n|Long 3P Sep 2023 @ 1.4 bought May 12 (receivership insurance lmao)|\n\nOn May 10 I figured \"Either they're fine and they will surge past 8 and I get to collect $300 premium + $200 profit when I eventually get assigned, or they're going to take a while to recover but at least I'll have a $3 cost basis when the call expires in 19 months\". The put is because I got spooked by the potential for a weekend FedDICking and wanted to get the put before any Friday afternoon dump, I plan to hold it until July-ish.\n\nI am still confident in my long position although I would certainly not buy in at $6 again.",

        "selftext": "# A Peek into the New Week: A Packed Monday on the Economic Front\n\nAs we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.\n\nHowever, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.\n\nFinally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/584rnx1zrlza1.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=accbf203f2939f299bb8f43e67f04b92ea4380f5\n\n**Daily Chart**\n\nBears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oojm7wa1slza1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff547c1510aba93b2e56b2988fa158c03b9d8914\n\n**15 Minute Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6l8ia773slza1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1bd774b4bd2fbaf2db6444875d064de41987b95\n\nBears swept the previous day's low at 409.97 and grabbed liquidity at the order block from May 10th. Buyers came in with increased volume. We saw a character change at 410.70 and swept liquidity at 411.58. We have resting liquidity above at 412.01. On the late bounce, bulls created a fair value gap at 410.47 - 410.80 and 410.39 - 410.27, currently holding as support AH. On the way down, bears left a few fair value gaps at 412.40 - 412.52 and 412.93 - 413.16 that bulls will look to fill on Monday.

        "selftext": "The trade was focused on PLTR and employed an anomaly detection strategy. In addition to my usual analysis, I integrated a novel tool - the Greek Moons.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn 5/5/2023, I invested in 8.00 call options for PLTR set to expire on 5/12/2023, at $0.20 per option. A week later, on 5/12/2023, I sold these options for $1.52 each, bringing in a total profit of $132,000.\n\n**The Data**\n\nThe successful execution of this trade depended on an anomaly detection strategy that harnessed the following data:\n\n* Daily PLTR Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume\n* 20, 50, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)\n* Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D)\n* Greek Moons data\n* VIX Gamma High, Low, and Spread\n\n**Key Insights & Anomaly Detection**\n\nThe linchpin of my strategy was identifying market anomalies, unusual patterns often signaling substantial price fluctuations. In this instance, the anomalies were pinpointed using Greek Moons, an advanced tool that aids traders in detecting unusual options market activities.\n\nThe Greek Moons tool averages Greek values based on expiration and moneyness and shows the rate of change daily. This information was pivotal in predicting an unusual move in PLTR. On 5/5/2023, the Greek Moons data, coupled with PLTR being below its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs, indicated a potential oversold condition. The Stochastic %K was also in oversold territory, adding further support to the potential for an upward price movement.\n\nBy 5/12/2023, PLTR's price had risen substantially, allowing me to sell my call options for a significant profit. The Stochastic %K had also moved into overbought territory, suggesting that PLTR's price might start to retreat, thus strengthening my decision to sell.\n\n**Deep Dive Data**\n\nThe subsequent data shows a detailed view of the market variables and indicators that led to my decision to trade on the specific dates:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Moons 1](https://preview.redd.it/3ona09qychza1.png?width=2099&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bfae7bb6ac3cba6346eaf7d315405776a9d2034)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Moons 2](https://preview.redd.it/znsr3jhzchza1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59be09e5248a049f5f4f24db0ec9b3785ef8e25e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PLTR Raw](https://preview.redd.it/rywbzai0dhza1.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70d0396b8e96e016f9f8afc777f25ff55fee0b97)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PLTR Position](https://preview.redd.it/lt7zazk1dhza1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e2528a1cd6fd8193b0fe1556aeeb0449c42434a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Strike Selection](https://preview.redd.it/fygq0vqcehza1.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=caeb050cc2e217f92965503ed04eea44aebfe27c)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis example demonstrates how unconventional data sources, such as Greek Moons, can complement traditional indicators in making trading decisions. It's important to remember, though, that past performance is not a definitive predictor of future results. The nature of the stock market is unpredictability, hence the importance of diligent research and a careful assessment of risk tolerance.\n\nI welcome your input and I am available to discuss any questions regarding my methodology.

        "selftext": "Well at this point I think people think I am a permabear\u2026 however, I really don\u2019t have a bias in this market and if you watch me trade intraday you know that I easily play calls and puts just as much\u2026 though I will say puts pay far better in this current market then calls ever do\u2026 But like my heading says \u201cits too late to be long but its still too early to be short.\u201d Someone posted this in a comment and it really hit me that its exactly how I feel in this market. \n\nLet me explain\u2026 going into this week I was fairly confident in a hot CPI which would have bene the bearish catalyst for no rate cuts, no pause and another 25bps rate hike in a month at FOMC\u2026 however, that did not obviously happen with that \u201ccooler\u201d CPI print we now find ourselves just barely scraping by from a market sell off\u2026 however, as this EOW price action would suggest we don\u2019t quite have the upside pressure bulls should have hear to take this higher. \n\nWe truly are in an extremely painful spot in this market\u2026 theta and IV crush is hitting like no other\u2026 there is no trend and there is absolutely no continuation. We are so far in my opinion overbought that I find it highly unwise to go long (plus I truly believe this market is literally scraping by on fumes and one of these days is going to let go) however, we clearly are being held up by big tech that its very unwise to go short\u2026 so what are we left to do here? Well first off ALWAYS remember CASH IS A POSITION! But honestly this is a day traders dream as we have some pretty solid movement that is really setting up for some nice intraday plays. \n\nI truly looking at the technicals (Which I will cover below) believe we are about as close to the top of this trend as we are going to get\u2026 however, we haven\u2019t gotten the signals and flashing red lights that its time to go short\u2026 for now its time to play the range and wait for us to pick a direction\u2026 \n\n**BONUS TESLA TA** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dljd304jtgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fda9e1cd1011d73bb9e4a5cf96740ebd9cddf466\n\nOn tesla Daily here we got a lot going on.. so I was VERY much so bullish EOD yesterday and was looking for the pump\u2026 the tesla ceo news caused the pump to the 173.98 targets I was looking for. Now this is where you gotta remember \u201cbuy the rumor sell the news.\u201d What actually happened is that this huge pump put in a huge high volatility bearish day\u2026\n\nThis is what we have right now is a bearish engulfing daily candle (4 day long actually), a failed breakout of this downward channel, and a closure back under that 168.57 demand which is the daily 8ema\u2026 this was a massive failed breakout and with this rejection a new supply at 172.27 was put in\u2026 that means our target is now the 160.87 supply. We also have bearish daily IV and with bearish price action. We also loss the red support line which was a 3 point touch\u2026 \n\nMy ultimate target for next week is 160.87 (-4.3%) with an extreme target of 153.8 (-8.9%). \n\nI took a half sized 167.5P 7dte put play for this\u2026 looking to hold till at least 160.87. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/25rwntljtgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81acc216e56ec5305ace8a5693de229c2061059a\n\nWell until the EOD pump (a classic for SPY) I was actually thinking we might finally see SPY rebalance itself by closing under that 411.15 supply. However, we actually closed back over that supply so as of right now we still would be considered imbalanced. So this still either needs to close under 411.15 OR attempt to turn 411.15 into demand (support). As of right now we are in the process of discovering our next demand (support). However, I do not have a true target for that yet. \n\nIt is extremely difficult (on spy at least) to find where this wants to end up\u2026 Our biggest support targets are 404.3 to 405.06 and resistance is 415.56 to 417.03. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iyjwb80ktgza1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b8b6e1a0ac27a30fe6d7a1fea2a08f4a4f05305\n\nThe weekly supply/ demand chart actually is the one thing right now that makes me VERY bearish\u2026 one of the indicators I use (I do apologize I can not share it nor can I discuss the interworkings of it) has officially finally signaled a BEARISH weekly reversal\u2026 what does this mean? It means that we finally have reached a place where the technicals are supporting further downside. \n\nSpy weekly did close below that 411.87 demand (support) that does open up a chance for a drop to at least the weekly 20ema which is 404.03\u2026 a bigger retrace would be to the 385.9 or 385.21 demand. However, outside of a black swan I would be shocked to see us go that low\u2026 most likely scenario is a retrace to the 390-400 area where we could actually establish a new higher demand (support) in order to propel us back to the 412-416 area. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ctge0hktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92dda5fb47b3ed2ffed0b0dd7106a2ddde1ee838\n\nThis daily trend is straight barcode\u2026 no other trend to be had here\u2026 WE actually for the last 6 trading days have CLOSED within the same $2.99 range\u2026 that is a very tight range. \n\nThe most bearish thing I can take away from this is that we now have a 3 point touch blue resistance line and did lose the support of the blue 3 point support\u2026 this opens up the potential to touch the support line for the bigger black rising wedge. That support sits at 408.2 for Monday. However the biggest bullish thing I can see here is that we have now for 3 trading days in a row bounced off the daily 20ema and closed over the daily 8ema. \n\nWith this bearish engulfing daily candle and rejection off resistance/ losing support I would personally favor downside with a target of 408.9.\n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/red74ovktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a28c030558af3dedbacf44bfaebfc8c546743a8\n\nA completely uneventful weekly chart here\u2026 we are still closing within the same $4.35 trading range for the 5th week in a row and we are still in that bigger $9.7 range for the 7th week in a row\u2026\n\nNow this rising wedge is about to come to a finally support test\u2026 410.61 is that key weekly rising wedge support. If that line breaks then that would in my opinion indicate a bigger sell off is about to start. WE also have a nice carrot top (v-top) forming here too. We actually have an extremely tight breakout/ down triangle here on SPY weekly with support at 410.61 and resistance at 411.78. \n\nOne very real scenario here is that we are going to see a fake breakout/ down and continue to range here.. I still personally would not be going long or short until minimally this $4.35 range is broken. \n\nSPY Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 416  \n Demand- 411.9 -> 385.9  \n Support- 411.6 -> 407.1 -> 404.4  \n Resistance- 416 -> 422\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7jbp0gltgza1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27a2759adfc3ab3a99865819396fd06742127986\n\nNow this daily futures chart actually shows a much different story\u2026 we actually today with this sell off managed to reconfirm 4153 as a KEY supply/ resistance. This supply is so important and strong that I actually am going to highlight it with a different style line\u2026 we did managed to close under the 4135 demand (support) too. With this 5 closures between 4133 and 4154 finally being broken there actually is a bigger chance of a sell off here\u2026 \n\nOur downside target would be 4074 on any major sell off. However, our upside target would be 4154 then 4190/4198 IF we managed to have a hefty bounce Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6bhuc70mtgza1.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80b9641de08918ee043f64a6be6d065d820a47ae\n\nThe futures weekly chart also shows bearish reversal conditions now too\u2026 I would have liked to see a closure under the weekly 8ema but we did retest 4173 supply (resistance) on the weekly and to the point rejected it. Our target still once again remains 4054 on a weekly time frame. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crgugsemtgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4541ef8b83ab0f34e78411d81d76e15b5081e442\n\nThe futures daily chart does make me feel and want to be far more bearish then SPY\u2026 We did manage to close below the daily 20 and 8em and closing under that 4134 support area. One other thing is that we perfectly rejected that blue resistance line making it a 4 point (extremely strong) line to watch. We also lost that 3 point support line. The final support now is the black rising wedge support at 4105 on Monday and the blue resistance would be 4160 on Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrkmttxmtgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=87087dac76322bd830a94bff6cca0964e3cad0a8\n\nFutures weekly in my opinion is showing a far different and far more bearish chart then SPY\u2026 what I am seeing here is that we are now closing below that month long range support of 4138. We did attempt to close under the weekly 8ema however, that eod push up of course stopped us from doing that\u2026 \n\nOur breakout triangle support is 4125 and resistance is 4140.\n\nOne thing I have highlighted here is that the 7 week post JPM collar (quarterly) roll is next week\u2026 now what USUALLY happens on week 7? Well usually what ever trend (Currently bullish) we are in will see a sizeable retrace from weeks 7 to week 11\u2026 \n\nNow when we keep in mind that there are perfect spy/ futures weekly bearish reversal conditions and that our breakout/ down triangles are coming to a point we very well might finally be seeing the top of this market\u2026 IF you believe in historical trends this is our opportunity to short. One thing to keep in mind is that occasionally week 7 will be the peak and the retrace doesn\u2019t happen till week 8\u2026 I have a bigger target of 4000 for futures if this trend was to hold true\u2026 So far this trend has been a solid one to watch since 2022. \n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6499egntgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22767f4e88559d7a5a2e2d0a7694eef74106c1b7\n\nTough trend here on the VIX as we actually broke through both support and resistance of the short term triangle\u2026 so we redraw that and re-evaluate next week\u2026 we are seeing that this 16.8 area is becoming a major support area\u2026 WE did once again fail to break through 17.72 though.\n\nWe should watch these two key levels for a direction\u2026 I will say from a volatility/ iv/ price action stand point I am actually seeing further downside on the VIX for now\u2026 \n\n**10YR YIELD AND DXY** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwl8y3zntgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b529b3454edd90fb92114e6560e08f438d670dd0\n\nThe biggest thing I have said im watching for is the DXY recovery and 10YR breakout\u2026 we have part one which is the DXY breakout and holding that breakout\u2026 the last step is for the 10yr to breakout\u2026\n\nWe are truly about as close to the top as we arguably are going to get\u2026 the signs are not 100% aligned yet\u2026 but there are a lot of things aligning that a sizeable correction is inbound. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sh3x3adotgza1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fb9b5f5069ebc0acca1edee42b0d774d3c5fb73\n\nLast week I put in my best week of profits for 2023 and I was 100% not trying to chase those gains as I know that is how people put themselves in a really bad spot and start taking poor trades and not securing profits\u2026 well after a very painful Monday and Tuesday I was able to secure my now most profitable week of 2023 again. \n\nToday was a great day of trading that I couldn\u2019t have been any happier with\u2026 I have really struggled the last few Fridays of trading but I was able to with this range finally adapt to it and truly exploit it. \n\nAfter a terrible February\u2026 I have now put in 5 green weeks in a row and have been green for 8 out of the last 9 trading weeks. \n\nThis market continues to be an extremely difficult one to navigate but everyday that SPY throws us a curveball and these markets do something new and unpredictable is another day we are learning and becoming better traders\u2026 Remember everything we learn now in this terrible bear market is information we will use to become that much more profitable traders in the next bull market.",

To be a master it takes years and TBH, I certainly cannot claim to have mastered options, but I do know them. When you do progress to becoming a consistently profitable trader it can be a very rewarding experience and I have learned along the way that there are certain rules that need to be adhered to. Some, you may think are obvious but I can tell you, I have seen other people break every single one and everyone will likely have done at least one of them at one point, if you end up doing this long enough...\n\n1. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS!\n\nDo not enter a trade just because someone else told you to! Do your own research, you need to know everything about the trade you are entering,\n\n2. ALWAYS TRADE WITH A STOP LOSS OR MAX LOSS IN MIND.\n\nBefore you enter a trade , already KNOW what you are prepared to lose on it and it should ALWAYS be less than you are hoping to make. (I would suggest as a guide that your loss should be no more than 50% of what you are hoping to make. Your stop loss can either be set based on technical, events or based on your affordability. It should basically reflect the loss that you are willing to accept to lose on a position. Irrespective of whether you are trading on the long side or on the short side, always you need to have that level where the position is just wrong and you need to have that discipline to exit a loser. (The only addendum I would add to this is that with equities or futures, you can put in an electronic stop which once placed, takes out the emotion of having to exit yourself, however, I would advise not to put it (stop-loss) in on an electronic platform option strategy, because it will likely get triggered when it shouldn't have due to liquidity. In this instance, if you have a system that can evaluate your option position at any given time, you will be able to see where the value is, so just know where your stop-loss level is and if your theo value gets there then you have to have the discipline to get out.) Which brings me to...\n\n3. DISCIPLINE!\n\nDo not move your stop-loss. If it gets triggered, accept it and walk away. The same can be said for booking profits. Profit is what is booked; all else is book profits. Keep taking your money off the table at regular intervals. There is NOTHING WRONG with making a profit. YOu may see something go further afterward, but that's fine, you have MADE MONEY and that's all that counts. I personally would use a trailing stop, which moves up along with my profitable trade.\n\n4. NEVER LET A WINNING TRADE TURN INTO A LOSING ONE.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have used a stop that moves up with my winners (eg; I book the profit if it retraces 10% off any recent high if it hasn't got to my target) but once clear and in the money at the very least put in a stop that will get you out for no loss.\n\n5. NEVER CHASE/ADD TO A LOSER\n\nDo not add to your position if your position is losing and you cant bear to take a loss, this is not a winning strategy. If your strategy is to average into a trade over a price range then that is totally fine, but doubling down in the hope the market will turn will burn you to the ground eventually.\n\n6. DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER\n\nThis is very important especially if you have had to book a loss. Traders tend to look back and over analyse. Also, when traders book profits and the stock goes further up, they tend to look back at the notional losses. Both are not advisable as they tend to detract from your core trading strategy.\n\n7. DON'T OVERTRADE/TRADE OUT OF BOREDOM.\n\nNot trading is also a strategy. This is something most traders tend to miss. Traders believe that trading strategy either means to buy or to sell in the market. But the most productive strategy can be to not do anything. This is very relevant when the market is very confusing and traders can get hit either way. Have your own plan and STICK TO IT!\n\n8. COSTS SHOULD BE CALCULATED INTO YOUR STRATEGY\n\nRemember, when you trade your cost is not just the brokerage you pay. There are all kinds of other charges like stamp duty, turnover tax, exchange fees etc. If you take delivery of shares, there are also expenses related to your account. The point being, that I know of traders who have grossed over $2mil at a firm and seen every penny of it eaten up by costs. And then there is margin. For all of you options and futures traders and anyone else who trades on margin, you should have a good understanding of how changes in a position may require more money to maintain them, even if they are doing well. All these costs and how margin changes (how much capital you'll need to maintain the position) over time need to be factored in when you project your trading profits and entering the trade.\n\n9. BE AWARE OF OVERNIGHT RISK\n\nDecide on a strategy that you like and stick with it market. Positions are normally intraday or for a few days. One of the biggest risks you need to be conscious of if the overnight risk. When there is uncertainty on the economic or geopolitical risk or there is a major event coming up, it is always advisable to be as light in the market as possible or at least understand what you really have at risk if things go pear-shaped but you're not there to do anything about it.\n\n10. STAY ON THE SIDE OF MOMENTUM\n\nWhen you are a trader, trend is your friend. You are more likely to make money as a trader if you trade according to the momentum. Trying to short a bull market does not make sense. Similarly, trying to catch a falling knife is also not the right idea. You trading strategy should be aligned to the direction of the momentum.\n\nRemember that there is NO WISHING, HOPING OR PRAYING. This isnt a game, you are here to make money. Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it. If you stick to rules, learn from your mistakes, be humble and respect the market and you will become a successful trader.\n\nsource: [https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules](https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules)",

This is the beginning of the next leg up, get in now and fill your bags before the news is released. \n\nNow the details..  \n\nGM and Microvast recently won a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which rewarded 200 million dollars to Microvast to build a factory in the US with GM support, to produce an advanced separator using IP from both GM and Microvast.  See here for more details: [https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html)\n\nRecently Microvast had a great earnings, beat expectations on margin quarter, raised guidance, enhanced margin.  This led to a more then 50% gain in one day, and a bit of a short squeeze as many many people and institutions have been shorting Microvast into the ground and were caught off guard by the quarter's results.  Check out the chart and volume last 2 days.  Based on the limited move, there are still many shorts that have yet to cover, and interest is way up.\n\nI believe I've identified some leaked information that will light the fuse on this rocket now considering the context that it finds itself right now.\n\nThis fuse is a leaked Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) dump that is the redacted joint application with General Motors and Microvast for the grant for their new factory to build advanced battery separator technology.\n\nIn this 240-page leaked redacted grant application to the Department of Energy (DOE) there is a boatload of very material information that has never been seen about the separator and the technology and the company.\n\nIn addition, there are several letters in support of Microvast applications from companies that have committed to purchasing the separators and other batteries from Microvast.  One of these letters appears to confirm that Oshkosh is in fact using Microvast batteries and separators for the USPS NGDV.\n\nWhile you can read through the entire thing here:  [https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K](https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K)\n\nI will focus this post on the Oshkosh / USPS / NGDV confirmation.\n\nFirst here is a screenshot of the letter (page 149) in the leaked FOIA DOE grant application (please read the whole thing but notice the language circled in red):\n\n[Leaked DOE application - with letter of support from Oshkosh including confirmed contract order](https://preview.redd.it/lwc7ariuzbza1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5de7b97c98d1b0306b7540c826b08827e41b205)\n\nNow let's take a look at the Oshkosh website here: [https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/en/brands-innovations](https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/en/brands-innovations)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Same Language - Fill in Oshkosh where redacted in DOE letter - same exact language](https://preview.redd.it/rpk8hudw0cza1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86bb6fd05e5d177411c7ff6622140a44ad73d2df)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there are several other letters that show confirmed orders and are interesting as well, and these are right around the same page numbers.  You can also see lot's of other really amazing stuff, not meant to be seen by us mere mortals.\n\nWe have a chance here to get in before this information is confirmed and made public.

According to Redbook sales, consumer spending recorded its slowest pace of growth since February 2021 last week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zeev3cak2aza1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b5d2358ab6be80260c31b43207fdb8098c3faa5d\n\n**The Business**\n\nGoogle has added over $100 billion to its market capitalization after unveiled new AI-centered features tied to Gmail and Workspace as its annual developers conference, Google I/O. 'AI' was mentioned over 140 times in its 2-hour Google I/O keynote. That's over 700 million dollars per \"AI\".\n\nPacWest stock plunged 23% after it said it lost 9.5% of deposit last week. They actually reported no deposit losses on May 3rd but the stock selloff scared the depositors and they lost 9.5% in 2 days (May 4-5). Like I mentioned in the weekend post, there is no rational in fear. This kind of self-reinforcing deposit outflow will likely to continue from one bank to another.\n\nHowever, banks today maintain significantly higher levels of liquidity compared to pre-pandemic times and even during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As long as there is no substantial decrease in the value of collateral assets  (like what happened to T-bills and office loans), the banking system remains fundamentally strong.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rd67lwdg5aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64ea70d9ce6577313f45e567a01bb46994f14d22\n\nI added a couple of \"Small Growth\" stocks (with a strong cash balance and lower PS ratio than before the pandemic) to my portfolio today (ZS and DDOG). As I have mentioned a couple of times, I think these stocks can thrive in a slow growth low interest rate environment. My other positions have not changed.\n\nSPY 6/15 400 Put\n\nIWM 6/15 165 Put\n\nTLT Jan 2024 110/115 leap call spreads\n\nDDOG Jan 2024 100 call\n\nZS Jan 2024 130 call\n\nI am happy to share my positions here.

This time we found ourselves in a $2.46 throughout the day\u2026 we did actually end up having a decent amount of volume at 70mil as of writing this\u2026 We have officially closed our 4th doji in a row and our 8th doji out of the last 9 trading days\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8d3wtmzv9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc629619c33c3daa82c40ac7d59f6bba51e7eb03\n\nWe still find ourselves in this same range and we have not been able to breakout of it for over a month now\u2026 \n\nWe still are imbalanced for now as we are closed over the previous established supply without making a new demand\u2026 currently the way price action reads is that if we are able to establish a higher closer tomorrow we actually could establish a new demand (support). However, honestly right now we are in the chop zone and there is absolutely no direction and i feel fairly confident when I say if anyone is playing a long or short then its just a guess\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ngfep30w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbc2e56e4e931279028a328b81b638b117a46dcb\n\nOn SPY daily we actually have two major patterns to watch\u2026 the first is the black diamond pattern and the second pattern is this blue breakout/ down triangle. As of right now key support tomorrow is 411.24 and key resistance is 413.7. If one of these levels breaks we could be eyeing a much bigger move in that direction atleast until the diamond support/ resistance is tested and broken. \n\nAs of right now we are riding the support of the daily 8ema which should and could allow for further continuation to the upside\u2026 but as you can see much like intraday now we just are finding new ranges to trade within and we have no continuation to the upside or downside. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point of view\u2026 bears want a minimum close under 411.87 but really under 409.5 (weekly 8ema), however, bulls would prosper most with a closure over 416 minimum. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  \n Demand- 405  \n Support- 411.9 -> 408.9 -> 408  \n Resistance- 412.8 -> 414 -> 415.7\n\n**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi988lm0w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55af0bb08001b704533fbdd4b151acf98eef506d\n\nPretty similar story here on futures as we are now wedged right between the 4153 supply and 4135 demand. Favoritism would go for a new supply to be confirmed and possibly if we get a bigger red day tomorrow we could re-establish 4153 as supply (resistance) which would be extremely bearish\u2026 \n\nHowever, if we break out tomorrow there is a chance we could push up to the 4190/4198 supply area and attempt to establish a new higher supply before coming back down. \n\nCurrently we are in the process of finding the next supply (resistance). \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/df45d731w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=444700afec691ceea4d9406124ad7bfd944cbfce\n\nFutures also turned its 4th doji in a row in today\u2026 however, we have a slightly different structure with a rising wedge but inside of that we are eyeing a real nice breakout/ down triangle. \n\nKey support is 4134 and key resistance is 4165. Whichever one of these targets is broken we should expect a continuation of that into next week. As of right now there is a pretty equal weighted case of dumping through 4134 and breakout through 4165. The technicals really do support both. This double bottom off 4134 with a follow up double top off 4153 would give me a bearish bias for tomorrow. However, this 4134 and 4153 levels are both extremely strong and important. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point the bulls want to see this close minimally over 4192, however, bears would be cheering for joy with a closure under 4137 but ideally under 4128. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4153 -> 4190  \n Demand- 4135  \n Support- 4134 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4153 -> 4180 -> 4192\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6enjyj1w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45fc4761c0a060e7c5630978cf6c209dbdb0c8f2\n\nThe VIX continues to fight right about this 16.96 (call it 17) area and that has been a major support area for the last 4 trading days, however, we have now attempted to turn that into resistance. If this is the VIX turning 17 into resistance then the favoritism would be to the downside not the upside here for VIX which would give a bullish push up to SPY. \n\nI am not too worried about the white falling wedge as that is not a super strong line yet\u2026 however, this red support line which makes a real nice breakout triangle for this blue falling wedge is one to watch\u2026 that support lies at 16.65 tomorrow\u2026 IF we lose that support then I would see this as a bear flag for the VIX which means the VIX likely heads back to the 15s next week and SPY up to the 415-420 area. \n\n**10YR YIELD AND DXY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pfag902w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b73a121ff4d269e43a19d7b364b2b6d606d4f11\n\nNow if you have been following my posts for a while you know the one thing I am watching for is tech to sell off\u2026 why? Because every single sell off for really the last 2-3 weeks has been led by the tickers in SPY/ DOW not by the NASD\u2026 so until tech finally shows weakness\u2026 we are stuck in this trend\u2026 one of the biggest things I am looking for is the breakout strength recovery of the DXY\u2026 as of today we FINALLY broke this two month long falling wedge\u2026 now this might be a failed breakout\u2026 however, as you can see by the curling upward EMAs.. this is looking like a heavy consolidation before a move to the upside\u2026 I will be watching for a move over and closing over the 102.196 area\u2026 IF and when that closure happens that should signal a breakage of the consolidation and move to the upside\u2026\n\nDXY regaining strength finally should take tech down finally\u2026 \n\nWe might into next week see TECH start its sell off\u2026 \n\nThe 10YR yield has not quite recovered yet and continues to show weakness and is just basing in this 3.306% to 3.607% area. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jxz7sg2w9za1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a3b1e7e1dd3fa672107ca236c89b0333629400e\n\nToday ended up being a REALLY great day\u2026 I am sitting just over my weekly goal as we head into the last trading day of the week.

Intro\n\nWelcome to the \"It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies\" series.  A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting.  I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century.  I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts.  This one is specifically about $ECL.  I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter.  I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit.\n\nI've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion).\n\nAt this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt.  \"Millionaires are made in Recessions\" as they say.  So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more.  There are really two different angles here that I will discuss.  The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Trick Is To Let Them Cook](https://preview.redd.it/7bdstuxty8za1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d5a780e8093b29400bb0370e67ea97ff139bba4)\n\n# 2. Water and Chips\n\nThe massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. [Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It Was There That I Started To Question About Water](https://preview.redd.it/jjd9lxo1z8za1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=634f3decb684e2cd20e3ba996da106988f41f952)\n\nWhat strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries.  Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task.  To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately **2,200** **gallons of water**; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below).  So a\u00a0large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to **4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day.** T**his equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty).**\n\nwow. numbers man... crazy.  Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is.  If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool](https://preview.redd.it/0xmsfyz3z8za1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=882f8fffeca837e1d1703d7ca466ebd5fedbd90d)\n\nThis Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size.  It holds about  660,000\u00a0US\u00a0gallons.  Which means, that for a large facility, you would need  7.3 of these fuckers full of water **a day** (copy and paste this image 7.3 times).\n\nIn a tropical climate, such as Taiwan,  droughts can bring production to a screeching halt.  Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC.  The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way.  Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and [the Water Wars are already starting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/arizona-scottsdale-water-cut-off-rio-verde-foothills-drought?ref=upstract.com).  I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that.  Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are **not** going to happen I would be grateful.\n\nSo, why do they need so much water?  A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water.  But, it's not *just* water. It's Ultra Pure Water.\n\n[Ultra Pure Water (UPW)](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/tools-resources/dictionary/purity-on-another-level-ultrapure-water/) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water.  The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB.  No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2.  From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive.\n\nSo, what does it mean when \"they use a lot of pure water\". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain.  There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.  They recycle it.\n\nThis is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group [NALCO](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water).  Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation.  See where I am going with this?  Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011.  I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at  $38.80 per share.  It has pretty much been forgotten about.\n\nIf you look up $ECL description on RH it says (>!Slut\\_!<Spoiler Alert: >!it doesn't mention semiconductors!<):\n\n>Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy.

The company was founded by Merritt J. Osborn in 1923 and is headquartered in St. Paul, MN. The listed name for ECL is Ecolab, Inc\n\nHowever looking into NALCO...\n\n* [They are listed here in Market Watches list of UPW makers.](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/ultrapure-water-equipment-market-size-share-report-2023-2030-2023-05-05)\n* [Have a website specifically addressing Micro-electronics water needs](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water/about/industries-we-serve/manufacturing/microelectronics)\n   * Also State they have worked with NXP semiconductors, I'm guessing in New Mexico, to reduce the waste of process cooling water\n   * Have a section on UPW\n* [Announced they are working with Microsoft](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water/news/2023/04/ecolab-will-join-microsoft-at-hannover-messe-2023)\n   * [More Intresting Microsoft news](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water/news/2023/03/ecolab-extends-collaboration-with-microsoft-to-help-enhance-water-data-visibility)\n* AND they are hiring in, you guessed it! Chandler, Arizona just outside of Phoenix.  Remember where those space age facilities are going?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[50-60 Miles Covers Both Intel and TSMC Facilities and Data Centers](https://preview.redd.it/gjpbkpu6z8za1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=448d407b46c5e67767d15b5abec228f00a5a8465)\n\nI actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now.  Trust me bro.  I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine.  [https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726](https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726).   I think they want to keep the details \"water-tight\".   This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet.  The Plants are still being built.\n\nIf you are wondering about the \"Data-Center\" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center \"US West 3\" in Arizona.\n\nThe future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock.  This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon.  When they do, **I THINK** the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment,  carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.\n\nThe best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL.  Bill Gates has done it for you.\n\n# 3.  William Henry Gates III\n\nI don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks.  My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile,  and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan.  If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft.   This isn't a surprise as the [largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bill-gates-ecolab-stock-51660936071).  He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022.  Billy knows a LOT about the  semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista\u2122 fame.  [The same bill gates that wants to build a super city in Arizona](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/bill-gates-is-building-a-smart-city-in-arizona/) and is investing in [water thirsty nuclear power.](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/bill-gates-says-new-project-is-a-nuclear-breakthrough)   [Also, Gates Foundation Commitment to Water](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/programs/global-growth-and-opportunity/water-sanitation-and-hygiene).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Doesn't Mention the 50&#37; in $MLNDA \ud83e\udd14](https://preview.redd.it/1g9hp7ebz8za1.png?width=210&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d5d843e6ac333beff8f1366c17cd2d92bdddf81)\n\n***Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5:***\n\n>I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident).  Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert.  Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves.  Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and [anything / anyone else he can use](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/water-restoration-arizona.html).  It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure.  He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future.  Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some.  \n>  \n>Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice.  With wells already dug and everything. What Luck!  It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants.  Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water.  Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse.  They are used to dump waste water into though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pcexjsfz8za1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=666143bc6cc7789e58ce88d6559a4a8591677b5a\n\n>The top land per state is:\n\n1. Louisiana\n2. Arkansas\n3. Arizona\n4. Nebraska\n5. Washington\n\n>That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and \"Carhenge\".  I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood.  Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji\u2122 water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA.  Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji!\n\nI believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for \"[global warming](https://twitter.com/goddeketal/status/1655658051855065090?t=0fqTNBwM8Q2B5HNU86b4Aw&s=19) causes\", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on.\n\nThe major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers.  Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc...  What he wants to do: [Smart City](https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154914651546479/) of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch.  I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part.\n\n# 4. The Stock\n\nAt the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: [Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ECL/insider-trades/).  Last Buy was August of 2022.\n\nCurrently, ECL is trading at $173.67.  Wish it was cheaper.  If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish.  Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon.  You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48.  Probably for taxes.  Probably...  Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, \"in may go away\" chestnut etc...  In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/576jmmyhz8za1.png?width=1657&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9fcfad06c63e94d22581790427327682f35fd555\n\nYou see a steep decline from  [late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively](https://www.google.com/search?q=ecolabs&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:12/22/2021,cd_max:1/31/2022&tbm=nws&sxsrf=APwXEdezFqmiEYFwTD8sg18MvQ6VcoER9A:1683405957982&ei=hbxWZKnMO7TC0PEPzvmGWA&start=20&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwjpoo3xx-H-AhU0ITQIHc68AQs4ChDw0wN6BAgEEBk&biw=1588&bih=761&dpr=1.21), as well as higher costs affecting their profits.  This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart.  There is your sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is there 2022 financial statement.  Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk).\n\n>[2022 annual report for ECL financials](https://s24.q4cdn.com/931105847/files/doc_financials/2022/ar/ecolab-annual-report-fy-2022.pdf)  \n>  \n>[Ecolab (ECL) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Margins Up](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/taxes/ecolab-ecl-q1-earnings-andamp-revenues-beat-margins-up/ar-AA1aDPdT)\n\nI like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends.   Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are [being sued by a bankrupt company](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/chemical-maker-tpc-group-reaches-30-million-bankruptcy-settlement-2022-10-27/).  NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit.\n\nSales increased, of course.  Growing demand for water control/automation and  [squeezing out every](https://savethewater.org/bill-gates-omniprocessor-future-water-technology/) [drop at](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30709273) peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade.\n\n# 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation\n\nThe other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation.  Their bread and butter.  Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say \"EcoLabs\" on them.  Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts.  Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends.  Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this.\n\nAs other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions.  There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further.\n\nCurrently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc.  The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap.  After that it's free game.  However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs.\n\nThings like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds.  There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment.  It's all about the control and efficacy of water.\n\nRecently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Carpet is Ohio](https://preview.redd.it/v1wpsj2jz8za1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=048c43d0ebf93b9217bbe20a238279c76773fdb5)\n\nSome people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. [Holy Shit](https://preventchemicaldisasters.org/chemical-facility-incidents/).  Just like Bill Gates had an investment in [vaccines](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/bill-gates-turns-10-billion-into-200-billion-worth-of-economic-benefit.html) pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?!  The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a  campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue.\n\n# 6.

To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control.  The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be.  by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure.\n\nMy positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls  in a few months.  This market fucking sucks and I miss JPOW's money hose so I am playing it safe until at least the banks figure their shit out. \"But that won't make me rich!\" ya, well, it won't make you broke either and you could have gotten in significantly lower if you heard me talk about it.  Like I said recessions/ bear markets are when you go long into plays like this.  Use your yolo's for betting on which company will fail, Ecolabs certainly Will (Gates) not.",
