        "selftext": "HP Inc. (HPQ) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results today, after-hours. The webcast will be available at www.hp.com/investor/2023Q2Webcast\n\nAnalysts forecast earnings of $0.760 per share compared to earnings of $1.08 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting sales of $13.07 billion, an decrease of 20.72% over the prior year quarter. For the current fiscal year, they expect earnings per share of $3.31 compared to $4.08 per share in the previous year. On average, the expected revenue is $55.09 billion, compared to $62.98 billion last year.\n\nHPQ\u2019s second-quarter performance is likely to have witnessed a negative impact of the slowdown in consumer demand for PCs and high inventory levels. HP witnessed the robust demand for its PCs during the pandemic-led work-and-learn-from-home wave. However, the reopening of economies and offices, inflationary pressure and recession concerns have been waning the demand for PCs.\n\nFurthermore, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This might have hurt HPQ\u2019s commercial PC sales in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the preliminary data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC) in April 2023, PC shipments in the January-March 2023 quarter plunged [29% year over year](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/10/idc-worldwide-pc-shipments-fell-29-first-quarter/) to 56.9 million units. The latest data compiled by the market research firm depicts the fifth consecutive quarter of a PC sales decline following two successive years of strong year-over-year growth, driven by the pandemic-led increased demand for remote working and online-learning tools.\n\nAccording to IDC, the year-over-year fall was mostly brought on by a decline in consumer demand for PCs, excessive inventory levels, and a dismal prognosis for the economy. PC demand fell as a result of persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty and softening IT spending.\n\nHPQ\u2019s Printing division\u2019s sales are likely to have been hampered by softened consumer demand. The consensus mark for the segment\u2019s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.58 billion, indicating a year-over-year drop of 7.8%.\n\nAdditionally, HPQ's second-quarter bottom line probably reaped the rewards of competitive pricing, strict cost control, and a superior product mix. The advantages are likely to be more than offset by decreased revenues, higher commodity prices, unfavourable currency exchange rates, additional expenditures in innovation, and the go-to-market strategy.\n\nThis sounds pretty bearish. What's interesting is that HP did beat EPS last quarter and still dropped. I think getting puts would be a pretty easy choice, considering everything above. I'll be grabbing the HPQ 6/2 30p for 41 bucks each. Unless you think they'll say \"AI\" a bunch of times, it would be unreasonable to grab calls.",

        "selftext": "Not financial advice!\n\nNvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard\u2019s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.\n\nSo\u2026 Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.\n\nIt's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.\n\nBut here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.\n\nAnd how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.\n\nNow, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.\n\nBottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting \"hybrid cloud or bust!\" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.\n\nIBM\u2019s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two\u2019s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO",

This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.\n2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.\n3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.\n4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",

But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. \n\nI was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.\n\nConfronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.\"\n\nLESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream\n\nIn 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. \n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n\"Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...\n\nWe suffered many years of poor performance. \n\nOur shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...\n\nThis journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.\"\n\nLESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work\n\nIn 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.\n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n\"The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...\n\nNvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. \n\nWe should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...\n\nOur strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.\n\nTo retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. \n\nRetreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.\"\n\n//\n\nJensen wrapped up the speech with this:\n\n\"Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:\n\n1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.\n2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.\n3.

Investing in the stock market involves a significant risk of loss, including the risk of loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.**\n\n**Disclosure: At the time of this publication, I, the author, personally hold a position in $NVDA. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.\n\nWhile the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.\n\n**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**\n\nBefore we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.\n\nLet's get into it!\n\nNvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.\n\nTo begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.\n\nIn the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.\n\nPreviously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.\n\nNVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.\n\nFibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.\n\nLet's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:\n\n1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67\n2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \\* 1.618 = 464.02\n3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15\n\nHowever, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.\n\nIn summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.\n\nDuring the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, where do we stand?**\n\nNvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bear Scenario:**\n\nWhile we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.\n\nOne notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.\n\nThese are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bull Scenario:**\n\nOn the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.\n\nFor perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.\n\nAs NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it\u2019s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Realistic Scenario:**\n\nBased on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.\n\nWhile it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!",

So far in 2023, food has been the most effective indicator for predicting inflation, with healthcare also growing in significance.\n\n**Are we nearing the 2% goal?**\n\nThere are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. After reaching a peak of 11.4% in August 2022, the year-on-year increase in U.S. consumer food prices was 7.7% in April 2023. Although most retail food prices are still higher than they were a year ago, the overall trend appears to be moving in a consumer-friendly direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8rftneu2u2b1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2bff257a6898ac43bc90494aef806f135f33bad9\n\n**What's causing the delay?**\n\nFirstly, it takes time for lower commodity prices to be reflected in retail food prices. Secondly, while energy costs have decreased from their peak and some supply chain issues have been resolved, wages and other costs continue to rise.\n\n**Where does this leave the Fed?**\n\nThe Fed finds itself in a tricky situation. Persistent economic strength and slow progress on bringing down inflation combine to make **a compelling case for additional rate hikes**. However, further tightening of monetary policy could pose **challenges for regional banks** and potentially **trigger larger shocks** for bigger players. It could also negatively impact other sectors of the economy.\n\nAll in all, despite their recent calm and cautious recovery, the markets are still liable to disappoint those who take all of the above as a cause for unguarded optimism.",

Strengthening of DXY and the Dollar: The U.S. Dollar is considered a safe-haven currency, meaning that during times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often seek to hold their assets in USD. When the debt ceiling is signed, it signifies that the U.S. government has taken steps to address its debt obligations, which can restore confidence in the economy and the stability of the U.S. Dollar. As a result, demand for the Dollar may increase, leading to its appreciation relative to other currencies, as reflected in the DXY.\n\n2. Decline in Stocks: The signing of the debt ceiling can sometimes create concerns about the potential impact on government spending and the overall economy. If investors perceive that the government's ability to meet its financial obligations is in question, it can lead to increased uncertainty and risk aversion in the stock market. Investors may sell off stocks and move their investments to safer assets, such as treasury bonds, causing stock prices to decline.\n\n3. Rise in Treasury Bonds: Treasury bonds are considered relatively safe investments backed by the U.S. government. During periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often shift their funds from riskier assets, like stocks, to the perceived safety of treasury bonds. This increased demand for bonds can drive up their prices and lower their yields. Consequently, when the debt ceiling is signed, and there is a restoration of confidence in the government's financial stability, investors may flock to treasury bonds, leading to their appreciation.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello Autists, \n\nToday I am presenting Redfin (RDFN) and why it can and will be a 200% play over the next two years. Yes, I did say 200%. Just on stock, not even counting options. Let's jump in. \n\n**Investment Thesis:** Redfin a super cyclical stock will be rebounding with great strength due to Online Real Estate Market Growth, AI investments, diverse Revenue Streams, and most importantly shrinking interest rate environment to kick it all off. They also got rid of their Buying program and implemented for the first time now the Redfin Premier Nationwide service to homebuyers. \n\n***What is Redfin?***\n\nRedfin is a residential online real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one\u2019s real estate needs. \n\nThey also use the same combination of technology and local service to originate mortgage loans and offer title and settlement services. They also offer digital platforms to connect consumers with available apartments and houses for rent.\n\n**Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**\n\nReal Estate agents have to be the biggest thieves taking 6% commission being a realtor. Every $1,000,000 home sold equals $60,000 in fees for a license that can be earned in 75 classroom hours. And requires no technical skills or degree. Nothing against real estate agents, but after watching Selling Sunset on Netflix and working in real estate investments myself, I am ready to see the real estate market adapt, and move past agents who don\u2019t provide more than $20 of value and headaches saying \u201cLocation, location, location\u201d so I can buy more FD and OTD\u2019s in my brokerage**.** \n\n**Investment Thesis Catalysts:** \n\n**Online Real Estate Market Growth and Market Share:** There is ongoing shift towards online platforms in the real estate industry that present an opportunity for Redfin to capture a larger share of the market. As more homebuyers and sellers embrace digital solutions, Redfin's technology-driven approach and user-friendly platform could lead to increased adoption and market penetration.\n\nIf any of you autists have ever used RDFN then you know first hand that there is a smooth process with limited conflict of interest since their agents are not commission based. People are becoming tired of the fees posed by traditional agents. Even though there has been a slow down in revenues across the real estate brokerage industry, going forward in a digital world I expect this to continue to grow. \n\nRedfin currently only has .78% of the entire market share in the US\u2026.there is room for growth for this billion dollar market cap company where they are actually not being thieves for 6%. \n\nThe company's growth initiatives, such as geographic expansion and strategic partnerships, will contribute to its market dominance and attract more customers. **They just initiated Redfin Premier Nationwide.**\n\nRedfin Premier is a specialized service that caters to high-end and luxury properties. It is designed to provide enhanced marketing and representation for luxury homes in select markets.Redfin Premier offers a range of features and services to sellers and buyers of luxury properties. These may include professional photography and video tours, custom marketing materials, targeted online advertising, and exposure on high-traffic websites and publications. And you know what they say\u2026luxury products bring luxury margins. \n\n**Redfin also launched in 2022 their acquisition from 2021 RentPath**, because lets be honest owning a home for many people right now is a pipedream and now has a rental search. This creates a new pipeline of consumers in different phases of life and I don\u2019t know how many of y\u2019all have been apartment shopping recently but damn these rents just keep going up. While Redfin is known for home buying and selling services\u2026 apartment rentals is a new slice of the pie to grow into. And most of the time M&A is a waste of time but this I think added value to Redfin. \n\n**AI Investments:** I knew by putting AI in this, some of yall would make your keyboard sticky. They are making continued investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis to make sure they provide personalized recommendations, improve user experience, and streamline the home buying and selling process to take consumer money and make us tendies. \n\n**Industry Trends:**\n\nReal Estate transactions have gotten wrecked. Interest rates affect this industry a fuck ton. Redfin\u2019s share price has plummeted since 2022. Interest rates and recessionary environments have made homebuyers less of a rush to close deals. \n\nMany experts in the mortgage industry see rates going down especially with the government preventing a US debt default. As the banking sector calms down. Economic data points towards a strong economy, and inflation eases, rates hopefully will go downward through the end of 2023. Fed tightening may put some upward pressure on mortgage rates in the near term, but ultimately more certainty about the Fed\u2019s actions will help to smooth out some of the volatility we have seen with mortgage rates. It is likely that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in May, which may represent the peak for the current round of policy tightening. Also if inflation surprises to the downside or recession fears intensify, mortgage rates could fall.\n\n**Risks/The Dirty: Why this Stock has fallen 90% from its peak.** \n\nReal Estate market got fucked worse than an episode of Brazzers. Interest rates got hiked worse than Johnny Sins morning wood and a recession made people less likely to move. This combination wrecked REITs, brokerages, growth stocks, every autists portfolios, even those losers in r/dividends with their measly .69 cents quarterly payments. \n\nRisks include \n\n* Interest Rates\n* Financial Health (They need to crank out some earnings, they are using preferred stock, stock based comp, and senior notes to get through rough times)\n* Housing Market (Back to interest rates, houses need to be being bought.)\n\nThe good news is, I see that the stock has been wrecked by the risks above. And as the light at the end of tunnel gets closer the stock should derisk itself assuming real estate armageddon does not hit and the stock price should go up. I do not think it will get anywhere near the former all time high stock price in the next couple years, but think it will bring great gains that outpace the general market. \n\n**Future Outlook from Q1 2023 Earnings:**\n\n* Reduced staff and made organizational changes, making support staff ratios to agents better\n* Focused on mortgage cross selling business, concierge services, expanding Redfin Preimer Nationwide\n* Exited the home buying business that again, fucked earnings like a scene out of brazzers. \n* Aim to return to the traditional broker model, increasing monetization.\n* Projected real Estate Service back to growth in Q2 2023 and strong double digit growth in rental and mortgage businesses. \n* They expected adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven or better for 2023, $190 million better than 2022.\n\n**Valuation Notes:**\n\nThe stock has been hammered\u2026look at the stock chart. A lot of worst case nightmare scenarios came true for RDFN. Now RDFN is not a real estate company or REIT, it is a brokerage but also a tech stock. One of the biggest surprises when analyzing RDFN is their price to sales ratio. \n\nRDFN has a P/S ratio of .51 which is incredibly low and before covid traded anywhere from 1.25 to 1.8 regularly. Because the company is not currently profitable it is a great ratio to do a quick comp. Meanwhile stocks like PLTR have a 14.6x P/S ratio. I know they aren\u2019t the same company or growth or macro factors. But as this stock continues to have a great 2023 and market cap grows, more and more institutional investors will enter this heavily cyclical stock that has the most to gain in a great economic cycle. \n\nAs revenues rebound and grow, hopefully becoming profitable, see no reason this stock cannot hit over $30 in 30 months. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nGood stock. Fucked from tough times past 2 years. Innovative product that actually provides value at much more of a discount then some 6% sucking vampire real estate agent. Buy for tendies. I like it as interest rates go down, house buying environment picks back up, continued expansion, and better margins. Hopefully the worst is behind us and as earnings grow and the stock derisks, stock price will spike. \n\n**Positions:**\n\n1600 Shares at $10.16, looking to add more. And looking to add leaps for 2024/2025.",

        "selftext": "# A High Stakes Game: A.I., U.S. Debt Ceiling, and the New Market Norm\n\n**May 27th Recap**\n\nThe stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.\n\nThis positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.\n\nAs a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.\n\n[**SPY hits 420.72 (0%) (T.P. 1) on the Daily Chart**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13mryz0/spy_technical_analysis_for_monday_may_22_2022/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ukln516rk2b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15c70e681269e721d5804d7b6b143f15a1fde3a4\n\n# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day\n\nAs the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.\n\nThe day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.\n\nAt 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.\n\nLastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.\n\n# COT Data - E-MINI S&P 500\n\nOverall, trading activity increases across all groups, with a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment changes. The increase in short positions among Dealer Intermediaries and Leveraged Funds suggests a growing bearish sentiment among these groups. Meanwhile, Asset Manager/Institutional and Other Reportables showed a shift towards a more bullish sentiment, increasing their long positions and decreasing their short positions.\n\nThe new COT report for E-MINI S&P 500 as of May 23, 2023, shows the following positions:\n\n* Dealer Intermediary: Long 491,690 (+48,280), Short 437,143 (+75,927), Spread 59,895 (-6,019)\n* Asset Manager/Institutional: Long 1,050,328 (+6,169), Short 422,716 (-8,405), Spread 220,961 (-10,174)\n* Leveraged Funds: Long 164,886 (+37,252), Short 682,787 (+53,877), Spread 53,056 (-4,147)\n* Other Reportables: Long 89,199 (+2,873), Short 235,642 (-17,703), Spread 7,195 (+285)\n* Nonreportable Positions: Long 248,726 (+5,119), Short 266,541 (-4,003)\n\n*The plus/minus numbers indicate the position change compared to the previous report. The numbers after the plus/minus represent each category's open interest percentage.*\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\nTLDR (u/[**farmtechy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmtechy/)**)** \n\nThis analysis, viewed through the lens of both 4-hour and 1-hour charts, maintains a bullish bias. The 4-hour chart anticipates a swing low aligned with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG) alongside a significant equilibrium at 415.39. On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.\n\n**H4 Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8q2znkirk2b1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4bf8fd84f3f079fc79b6c258f5512bd0fb81780\n\nBias: In the context of the 4-hour chart, the present market analysis leans towards a bullish inclination, predicting a swing low on the H4 chart that aligns with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG). Additionally, a notable balance point is observed at the level of 415.39.\n\n**Critical Levels to Monitor**\n\nPrior Day High: 420.77\n\nPrior Day Low: 415.25\n\nFair Value Gaps: *(Fair Value Gaps refer to situations where market inefficiencies or imbalances exist.

The focus is primarily on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) spanning from 415.90 to 416.88 and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB) from 414.75 to 413.85. These zones fall within the current dealer range's discount zone, notably below the halfway mark of 417.38.\n\n**Critical Levels to Monitor**\n\nCurrent Dealer Range *(note that this range is only viable if we maintain the current high and break the character change at 419.05.)*\n\n0%: 420.89\n\n50%: 417.38\n\n100%: 413.87\n\nChange of Character: 419.05 *(Candle close below this level and look for FVGs and order block as downside targets)*\n\nFair Value Gaps: *(Fair Value Gaps refer to situations where market inefficiencies or imbalances exist.

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Every single time the yield curve has gone negative since the 1950's, there has been a recession.](https://preview.redd.it/crz4m4g8rb2b1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b87eb91bd9672907441514005521b1a26456306)\n\nFor context: VM was annoyingly not letting me post my picture without text, so I told ChatGPT to write how the inverted yield curve is going to lead to economic doom, but as an emo kid.\n\nSo, apparently, the yield curve has decided to play with our emotions once again. Brace yourselves, because it's inverted. Yeah, that's right, the long-term interest rates have taken a nosedive, sinking below the short-term rates like it's the end of the world. And you know what that means, right? Another recession might just be lurking around the corner. But hey, who am I to rain on your parade? Let's dive into this dark abyss and explore why this inverted yield curve is yet another ominous sign of impending economic doom.\n\nUnderstanding the Yield Curve: Let's get into the nitty-gritty of this twisted financial phenomenon. Normally, the yield curve should slope upwards, giving us a glimmer of hope that things will get better in the future. But oh no, not this time. When the yield curve decides to go all emo on us and flip itself upside down, it's a clear indication that trouble is brewing. It's like the universe is saying, \"Hey, you thought life was going well? Think again, losers!\"\n\nHistorical Precedence: You know what they say, history loves repeating itself. And guess what? The inverted yield curve has become quite the trendsetter in predicting recessions. It's like this emo prophet, always warning us of the impending financial darkness. It predicted the 2008 global financial crisis, the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, and the recession of 1990-1991. So, buckle up, my fellow melancholic souls, because the yield curve is at it again, waving its recession flag high and mighty.\n\nRationale behind the Yield Curve's Predictive Power: Oh, the reasons behind this madness? They're just as gloomy and brooding as you'd expect. Prepare yourself for a journey through the darkest recesses of financial despair.\n\n1. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior: Ah, the melodrama of it all. An inverted yield curve reflects the collective fear and anxiety of investors. They're like a bunch of moody artists, analyzing every economic indicator, overthinking it all, and adjusting their portfolios accordingly. It's like they're saying, \"Life sucks, so let's invest in long-term bonds and drown in our sorrows together.\" Their actions shape the yield curve, giving us a glimpse into their pessimistic souls.\n2. Anticipation of Monetary Policy: Oh, those central banks, always messing things up. When the economy is doing well, they just can't help themselves but tighten the monetary policy. It's like they're taking a sledgehammer to a delicate flower, completely oblivious to the damage they're causing. And guess what? An inverted yield curve might just be their way of saying, \"We're tightening things up so much that you can kiss economic growth goodbye.\" Thanks a lot, central banks, you've truly outdone yourselves this time.\n3. Liquidity and Credit Conditions: Who needs money anyway? With an inverted yield curve, borrowing becomes a nightmare. Short-term borrowing costs shoot up, making it nearly impossible for businesses and individuals to access credit. It's like the universe is conspiring against us, pushing us into a corner and laughing at our futile attempts to stimulate the economy. Good luck trying to invest and spend when no one wants to lend you a single penny.\n4. Market Expectations of Future Growth: Oh joy, let's talk about expectations. An inverted yield curve is the epitome of pessimism. It's like the market is saying, \"We're screwed, so you might as well join us in this downward spiral.\" Investors and businesses start believing that the future is bleak, and surprise, surprise, their actions align with their despair. They reduce spending, cut back on investments, and inadvertently push the economy into a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom.\n\nConclusion: Well, folks, here we are again, on the brink of yet another recession, all thanks to our dear friend, the inverted yield curve. It's like life has a sick sense of humor, continuously reminding us that we can't escape the darkness that engulfs our financial world. So, go ahead, embrace your inner emo kid, because the yield curve has spoken, and it's predicting yet another round of economic misery. Prepare for the tears, the gloom, and the impending doom.",

        "selftext": "Market sentiment is the overall attitude of investors or traders in a given financial asset or class. The sentiment can be calculated in many different ways. These range from mathematical formulas based on how many people are speculating on a specific security to industry-wide surveys. Everyone has access to simple tools like technical analysis tools that attempt to quantify precisely this.\n\nIt is never perfect because bubbles can always get bigger, and fear often only reflects how many participants are involved. Think of how many buyers there would be for farmland post-nuclear war. While an extreme example, it is a good reminder that things can always get worse.\n\nToday's market sentiment is terrible, especially in specific assets like energy and agriculture commodities. There is a lot of weather risk in the near term. You can use google trends for searches such as \u201crecession\u201d or \u201cdebt-ceiling\u201d to see how everyone searches for the same fear-driven terms.\n\nHistorically, these are the best times to buy. Intuitively, this is easily understood. When everyone else buys homes, it is an excellent time to sell. Buyers drive home prices, not sellers.\n\nIt is easy to say this. It is hard to do in practice. Yet, if everyone did this, the sentiment indicators would not work, and everyone would be rich. So it is especially important to remember when fear takes over, it is almost guaranteed people will eat, drive, and continue living their lives.\n\nIt almost always pays to be buying when others are scared. History suggests this is one of those times. Updated from the Easy Newz Mobile App",

The market decided it wanted to pullback and test 410 support first, however, with our first closure over 420 since August 19th I believe this bull run is just getting started. \n\nLooking back I was one day too early on Wednesday with my swing calls\u2026 shoulda done 3-7dte like I had considered before. \n\n**EVENTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjawr42f292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f6a74b8df808c5d509fe3c94f04848d9b0481b9\n\nFirst of if you didn\u2019t know\u2026 the markets are all closed Monday! \n\nWe have 4 fed speakers spread out through the week next week. And we also have a ton of heavy hitting data Wednesday through Friday. The most important one that I am waiting is JOLTS Wednesday, non farm Thursday and unemployment rate Friday. \n\n**MAKE IT MAKE SENSE** \n\nIf you remember post the last two FOMCs JPOW basically said we are not going to stop rate hiking and that will we will not see any rate cuts in 2023\u2026 What did markets do? Markets priced in a bunch of rate cuts by EOY (100bps cuts at one point but for the most part it was 75bps) and that sent the markets absolutely rallying\u2026\n\nNow look at this\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zz3tzxf292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3eecde1daf44217102f585f046257a9f47193799\n\nIn the last week the markets have went from a 17.4% odds of a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting to now a 71.1% chance of a rate hike\u2026 yet what happened this week? We rallied..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4skx0yeg292b1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1efd0606e4d1038f89c4bdf4c1d4e015d5e14e3\n\nNow not only that\u2026 but the markets went from just one week ago today pricing in a 44.7% odds of 75bps rate CUTS by end of year to now pricing in 39.4% odds (the highest odds) that we do not see any rate cuts by end of year\u2026\n\nNow I know markets can be a bit wacky\u2026 but how does it make sense that the markets went from expecting a fed pause and 75bps of rate CUTS by end of year to now expecting 25bps of rate HIKES next meeting and NO CUTS in one week and that week closes green on SPY?\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioj7hwug292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eade7000993438ab102dffbc0d87b6cedc9ae1cd\n\nOn the Daily we officially established a new demand (support) at 414.55. As I suspected if we pushed higher we would indeed make a new demand. The daily DMI is now waving higher and we have a new demand with bullish weekly support\u2026 the upside is what I would be looking for here and there is no real sense in shorting SPY right now. \n\nWe also closed over 418.78 and 419.5 supply\u2026 this means until we put a new supply in and we would need two red days back to back to do that our target remains the 429.68 area I pointed out last Friday. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6em1p7gh292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=039edc470710c16059fb26c6ed31d5e9fffe3916\n\nOn a weekly time frame here the bears actually put up a REALLY big fight and until today the weekly was going to make a new supply and at one point we attempted to set up a closure below the weekly 411.46 demand. Nonetheless though bulls pushed us and we now sit over the 416.09 weekly supply after retesting support of the 411.46 demand. The weekly DMI continues to wave up and we also continue to push higher with no new weekly supply\u2026\n\nOur target remains 427.35 and in the chance we blow through that roof I have no major supply level until 453.23. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqc4yjvh292b1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c9a75f31c6247f77f5f203e618d77ff8843b853\n\nAs you can see from the daily here we once action have made a new lower rising wedge support (this has been a theme for a while now). We also had a very nice v bottom off of 410.53 and we have for the first time since August closed over 419.5 resistance. Its not pictured here but this orange channel has a upper resistance of 427.5. As of right now that is the bulls target. \n\nWe will keep a close eye on that red rising wedge though as this resistance could still with 3 touches hold as resistance into next week. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szf7dm9i292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce33d0f981be02e49c07259d241af7ff44a415e4\n\nAs you can see we are in a bigger blue rising wedge that days back to September and we are also in more of a short term black/ blue rising wedge.\n\nThis blue rising wedge resistance is all the way up at 434.27 for next week and shows a clear path to 430-440 by end of June. The black rising wedge resistance sits at 425.4 for next week. The way this weekly candle with the very long wick bounce off the weekly 8ema is makes me believe in continuation to the upside for next week. \n\nSPY Weekly levels   \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5 -> 381.7  \n Support- 418.6 -> 411.6 -> 407.7  \n Resistance- 422 -> 427.4 -> 431.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqa402pi292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c390ef92761d2bca397c3b37ea1f37d424cfece9\n\nOn the daily chart here for futures we did have one demand left at 4198 and we officially with establishing a new demand (support) at that critical 4156 area actually have just opened the door to the upside in a big way. \n\nWith a daily closure over 4208/4216 supply our next logical upside target is 4311. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7n40l6j292b1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac8eb806fe60422dc6f8bedaedeaffaaa85d62e3\n\nFutures weekly is the same story as spy\u2026 we attempted to put in a new weekly supply and we also attempted to lose 4130 demand for a while. However as it would be the bulls bounced us right off 4130 demand and now have closed us over 4193 supply. With this move up and the weekly DMI moving up along with no new weekly supply\u2026 our favoritism here would be to test 4284 and if we break through that the next major level is all the way up at 4540. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3esl1cnj292b1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdf1ba368fc0c371618787b435703ba46b8442d0\n\nLooking at the daily here on futures we are currently sitting in our 4075 to 4310 channel. Being that we are pushing up that leaves our upside target as 4310. Our rising wedge structure on futures is much different than SPY when we come to resistance but the same support wise. Currently the red rising wedge resistance sits at 4235 for Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u69lzi3k292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb0ce6caba041244dd4e219ac5291bb68d7b058c\n\nOn the weekly here you can see that we have the same structure as SPY weekly with the blue rising wedge that slightly bigger followed by the black one. We are now sitting in this 4280 to 4135 channel. Being that we back test the weekly 8ema and 4135 support and was able to hold that shows that we are still bullish here. The black resistance sits at 4243 and the blue rising wedge sits at 4268 for next week. \n\nOne interesting thing I follow is the JPM collar 7/ 11 week movement. As I said is that usually week 7 to 11 reverses\u2026 however, in the chance that the trend does not reverse (which appears to be what is happening right now) then we usually actually see that trend continue even more aggressively. That would mean a potential 3 long bull run could be starting here. \n\nThat would mean our target is 4300 which is the current JPM collars calls. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4193 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4184 -> 4132 -> 4075  \n Resistance- 4230 -> 4283 -> 4328\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq4mlrmk292b1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d2df51c33ea8cb8576188b32b689dd4397a4b21\n\nLooking at QQQ daily here we absolutely have rocketed since we put in that 331.35 demand. We now are starting to knock on the door of that 351.57 demand now. \n\nIf this momentum continues which daily DMI and extreme bull momentum says it should we then should start to looked 351.57 demand -> 357.09 supply and finally the ultimate target of 361.7 demand. \n\nHowever, if we were to retrace at all we should find some major support at the 336.37 to 337.6. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/008lc44l292b1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4d8ed1faea00c2dd58260d1903efce4531c195a\n\nFrom the weekly stand point here this charts actually is just insane its pretty much just vertical for the last 2 months now. \n\nThe bears once again were not able to put in a new weekly supply and the DMI remains waving up with extreme bull momentum. The weekly 8ema which will be around 330.67 next week should once again be considered strong support. \n\nAs of right now the target remains 361.85 and if we happen to go on that 3 week bull run or a blow off top my target is 382.9/ 384.54 demands.\n\nQQQ Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 361.85 -> 330.67 -> 318.64 -> 306.06  \n Demand- 384.54 -> 382.9 -> 322.47 -> 318.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3583bykl292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6bc8d33bc77a29ef12c24dca3a62cf2aab4d608d\n\nNow here on the VIX we also put a new carrot top in\u2026 the one really interesting thing to me here is the fact that the VIX dumped pretty aggressively all morning and we saw almost -10% at one point and I thought we were going to approach the 16.92 support area\u2026 however, what happened that was very interesting is that the VIX actually continued to rise today even though SPY was rising. \n\nThere was a lot of oddities about today trading but the biggest one remains that from pretty much 1130 until EOD the VIX continued to hold flat and then began to rise\u2026 however, SPY also began to rise. It definitely is a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t occur often and makes trading hard. \n\nThe VIX closed at 17.95 just under that critical 17.97 support. I will be watching Tuesday to see if the VIX continues to sell off or not. \n\nThe VIX most certainly was reacting (the market) to the fact that a debt ceiling agreement has NOT been reached and as far as I know they are about to go to recess and will not be back in session until Tuesday. Which means according to Yellen if we run out on the 1st that they will have essentially two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) to come to an agreement\u2026 \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eemhb0m292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc15b397b0569b0c16361a8397efc60364cdeb8c\n\nNow I follow the 10yr and DXY every day but I don\u2019t really talk about it every day\u2026 but I do find it very interesting that DXY and 10YR both are in the exact same bull channel since the 2nd week of May. \n\nWhat I also find interesting is that DXY and 10YR daily look like a massive cup and handle which means DXY should hit 105.13 to 105.63 again and 10YR should hit 4.011% to 4.049% again. \n\nWhat really is odd about this is the fact that the last time DXY was at this level was March 13th to March 17th, February 16th to February 23rd, and December 13th to January 6th. \n\nSpy traded (at close) 385.36 to 389.99, 408.28 to 400.66 and 401.97 to 388.08 during those time periods for an average SPY closing price of 395.67. That means with our closure at 420.02 SPY is trading 6.1% higher than it was when DXY has traded at these levels in the past or about $25. \n\nThe last time the 10YR was at these levels was March 10th, February 10th to 15th, January 3rd to 5th and December 23rd. During those time periods SPY traded at close at 385.91, 408.04 to 413.98, 380.82 to 379.38 and 382.91. For an average at close trade price of 389.98 which is about $30 higher than current close or 7.7% higher. \n\nWhat does that mean? Well it could mean everything or it could mean nothing\u2026 I just find it interesting that over the last 6 months when the 10YR and DXY have been at these levels historically SPY has been trading much much lower. It also is very odd to watch the 10YR and DYX continue to rise each day as SPY and TECH continues to rise\u2026 \n\nThis all feels very much like something is going to break and its going to break in a big big way\u2026 the question is just when. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\nToday was another tough day of trading for me and I ended up closing out a small red day. The last month or so now I have found it extremely difficult for me to remain profitable on Thursday and Fridays. I seem to be in this cycle of absolutely killing it on Monday through Wednesday and then struggling like crazy on Thursday/ Friday. \n\nHonestly for me it all comes down to my strategy. My strategy as I have mentioned relies on the technicals of the market. I do not share my full strat but some things I look at and put a ton of weigh in is momentum, DMI, VOLD and VIX. The hardest part about these explosive rallies we have had lately is the fact that those metrics are not aligning. The other hard part is that there is times where after the huge run up where the technicals will point to a perfect put entry\u2026 of course I take that and the issue is that the techncials immediately cycle but little to no movement is ever had. \n\nThe other issue is that it seems like lately premiums at least the last two days for sure have completely lagged moves. I know this morning I played two puts and a call. None of those seemed despite winning on all three to pay any decent reward. I had a few mid day plays too some I closed small wins/ loss and others I stopped that for the size of the move that happened the premium did not reward us very much at all\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i7l73jm292b1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7af14251eb9addddf08cb9f0934aa2ecd9bd0692\n\nI actually did close out my most profitable week of the year again and this is now my 8th green week ibn a row making it my longest win streak of 2023 and my 2nd longest of the last 2 years. \n\nOne interesting this is that this is also my 2nd lowest weekly win rate of 2023. I had a great beginning of the week but lately as I have said I struggled to close. \n\nI have a really nice 3 day weekend again and I have a few things I would like to back test and I have the time to do it. I have one more indicator I use and have on my charts all day as I trade but I don\u2019t necessarily use it on every entry\u2026 I am considering if its time to put more weight into it\u2026 but I will not be able to do that until I back test\u2026 \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and for any of you who have had a someone you know whether a friend or family member serve and lost their lives defending our country\u2026 I truly thank you for your sacrifice.

The market decided it wanted to pullback and test 410 support first, however, with our first closure over 420 since August 19th I believe this bull run is just getting started. \n\nLooking back I was one day too early on Wednesday with my swing calls\u2026 shoulda done 3-7dte like I had considered before. \n\n**EVENTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dvogrhn392b1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c2f10ffd1db0942b10439420ed62bc5d7f29505\n\nFirst of if you didn\u2019t know\u2026 the markets are all closed Monday! \n\nWe have 4 fed speakers spread out through the week next week. And we also have a ton of heavy hitting data Wednesday through Friday. The most important one that I am waiting is JOLTS Wednesday, non farm Thursday and unemployment rate Friday. \n\n**MAKE IT MAKE SENSE** \n\nIf you remember post the last two FOMCs JPOW basically said we are not going to stop rate hiking and that will we will not see any rate cuts in 2023\u2026 What did markets do? Markets priced in a bunch of rate cuts by EOY (100bps cuts at one point but for the most part it was 75bps) and that sent the markets absolutely rallying\u2026\n\nNow look at this\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blu244xn392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4eda7bc2acf405afe29d01980e5c803c2fa99d1e\n\nIn the last week the markets have went from a 17.4% odds of a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting to now a 71.1% chance of a rate hike\u2026 yet what happened this week? We rallied..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22wl8rbo392b1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=336efbba37e305e6f296b3d94047e9fd35ac1e67\n\nNow not only that\u2026 but the markets went from just one week ago today pricing in a 44.7% odds of 75bps rate CUTS by end of year to now pricing in 39.4% odds (the highest odds) that we do not see any rate cuts by end of year\u2026\n\nNow I know markets can be a bit wacky\u2026 but how does it make sense that the markets went from expecting a fed pause and 75bps of rate CUTS by end of year to now expecting 25bps of rate HIKES next meeting and NO CUTS in one week and that week closes green on SPY?\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxuvczro392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=854edb5bba0c1c3aac8326427c162971a58ca97e\n\nOn the Daily we officially established a new demand (support) at 414.55. As I suspected if we pushed higher we would indeed make a new demand. The daily DMI is now waving higher and we have a new demand with bullish weekly support\u2026 the upside is what I would be looking for here and there is no real sense in shorting SPY right now. \n\nWe also closed over 418.78 and 419.5 supply\u2026 this means until we put a new supply in and we would need two red days back to back to do that our target remains the 429.68 area I pointed out last Friday. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvap7d7p392b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0755f3d06a07c476cdc564f7a662d224b5fe77cf\n\nOn a weekly time frame here the bears actually put up a REALLY big fight and until today the weekly was going to make a new supply and at one point we attempted to set up a closure below the weekly 411.46 demand. Nonetheless though bulls pushed us and we now sit over the 416.09 weekly supply after retesting support of the 411.46 demand. The weekly DMI continues to wave up and we also continue to push higher with no new weekly supply\u2026\n\nOur target remains 427.35 and in the chance we blow through that roof I have no major supply level until 453.23. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tdzi1pp392b1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55ca6ba5ee0e71703ba1d90fe82a793d625bbb4d\n\nAs you can see from the daily here we once action have made a new lower rising wedge support (this has been a theme for a while now). We also had a very nice v bottom off of 410.53 and we have for the first time since August closed over 419.5 resistance. Its not pictured here but this orange channel has a upper resistance of 427.5. As of right now that is the bulls target. \n\nWe will keep a close eye on that red rising wedge though as this resistance could still with 3 touches hold as resistance into next week. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kltuvx4q392b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=585d42060e3f93ff6618500700b3b392f5fdaaed\n\nAs you can see we are in a bigger blue rising wedge that days back to September and we are also in more of a short term black/ blue rising wedge.\n\nThis blue rising wedge resistance is all the way up at 434.27 for next week and shows a clear path to 430-440 by end of June. The black rising wedge resistance sits at 425.4 for next week. The way this weekly candle with the very long wick bounce off the weekly 8ema is makes me believe in continuation to the upside for next week. \n\nSPY Weekly levels   \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5 -> 381.7  \n Support- 418.6 -> 411.6 -> 407.7  \n Resistance- 422 -> 427.4 -> 431.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu2oa9jq392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2adcd265f3cecb15fea8db51121a5e2ae917b868\n\nOn the daily chart here for futures we did have one demand left at 4198 and we officially with establishing a new demand (support) at that critical 4156 area actually have just opened the door to the upside in a big way. \n\nWith a daily closure over 4208/4216 supply our next logical upside target is 4311. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji8qvi1r392b1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f730d5c7b1c72902cdbc9c94c4a7f8030d54e77d\n\nFutures weekly is the same story as spy\u2026 we attempted to put in a new weekly supply and we also attempted to lose 4130 demand for a while. However as it would be the bulls bounced us right off 4130 demand and now have closed us over 4193 supply. With this move up and the weekly DMI moving up along with no new weekly supply\u2026 our favoritism here would be to test 4284 and if we break through that the next major level is all the way up at 4540. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8b3pz7mr392b1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d0f8f04288ab06a68d8ace22c02003fa4411b21\n\nLooking at the daily here on futures we are currently sitting in our 4075 to 4310 channel. Being that we are pushing up that leaves our upside target as 4310. Our rising wedge structure on futures is much different than SPY when we come to resistance but the same support wise. Currently the red rising wedge resistance sits at 4235 for Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6g4ofg2s392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b3ae3af89f3e67697b70afbf011be10f9854257\n\nOn the weekly here you can see that we have the same structure as SPY weekly with the blue rising wedge that slightly bigger followed by the black one. We are now sitting in this 4280 to 4135 channel. Being that we back test the weekly 8ema and 4135 support and was able to hold that shows that we are still bullish here. The black resistance sits at 4243 and the blue rising wedge sits at 4268 for next week. \n\nOne interesting thing I follow is the JPM collar 7/ 11 week movement. As I said is that usually week 7 to 11 reverses\u2026 however, in the chance that the trend does not reverse (which appears to be what is happening right now) then we usually actually see that trend continue even more aggressively. That would mean a potential 3 long bull run could be starting here. \n\nThat would mean our target is 4300 which is the current JPM collars calls. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4193 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4184 -> 4132 -> 4075  \n Resistance- 4230 -> 4283 -> 4328\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1f97tis392b1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e37963a0ece9f7f748083adacde0bbc972e01494\n\nLooking at QQQ daily here we absolutely have rocketed since we put in that 331.35 demand. We now are starting to knock on the door of that 351.57 demand now. \n\nIf this momentum continues which daily DMI and extreme bull momentum says it should we then should start to looked 351.57 demand -> 357.09 supply and finally the ultimate target of 361.7 demand. \n\nHowever, if we were to retrace at all we should find some major support at the 336.37 to 337.6. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e10lvl3t392b1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8efd0f696c32561732032f6c03e18c37118c278a\n\nFrom the weekly stand point here this charts actually is just insane its pretty much just vertical for the last 2 months now. \n\nThe bears once again were not able to put in a new weekly supply and the DMI remains waving up with extreme bull momentum. The weekly 8ema which will be around 330.67 next week should once again be considered strong support. \n\nAs of right now the target remains 361.85 and if we happen to go on that 3 week bull run or a blow off top my target is 382.9/ 384.54 demands.\n\nQQQ Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 361.85 -> 330.67 -> 318.64 -> 306.06  \n Demand- 384.54 -> 382.9 -> 322.47 -> 318.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65edf4kt392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=654b5d07fb5ddb09a90a3467df2bc2df251883ad\n\nNow here on the VIX we also put a new carrot top in\u2026 the one really interesting thing to me here is the fact that the VIX dumped pretty aggressively all morning and we saw almost -10% at one point and I thought we were going to approach the 16.92 support area\u2026 however, what happened that was very interesting is that the VIX actually continued to rise today even though SPY was rising. \n\nThere was a lot of oddities about today trading but the biggest one remains that from pretty much 1130 until EOD the VIX continued to hold flat and then began to rise\u2026 however, SPY also began to rise. It definitely is a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t occur often and makes trading hard. \n\nThe VIX closed at 17.95 just under that critical 17.97 support. I will be watching Tuesday to see if the VIX continues to sell off or not. \n\nThe VIX most certainly was reacting (the market) to the fact that a debt ceiling agreement has NOT been reached and as far as I know they are about to go to recess and will not be back in session until Tuesday. Which means according to Yellen if we run out on the 1st that they will have essentially two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) to come to an agreement\u2026 \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fypqqkzt392b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa0ebd1a2c5475310d54a135a904d3044a1e421d\n\nNow I follow the 10yr and DXY every day but I don\u2019t really talk about it every day\u2026 but I do find it very interesting that DXY and 10YR both are in the exact same bull channel since the 2nd week of May. \n\nWhat I also find interesting is that DXY and 10YR daily look like a massive cup and handle which means DXY should hit 105.13 to 105.63 again and 10YR should hit 4.011% to 4.049% again. \n\nWhat really is odd about this is the fact that the last time DXY was at this level was March 13th to March 17th, February 16th to February 23rd, and December 13th to January 6th. \n\nSpy traded (at close) 385.36 to 389.99, 408.28 to 400.66 and 401.97 to 388.08 during those time periods for an average SPY closing price of 395.67. That means with our closure at 420.02 SPY is trading 6.1% higher than it was when DXY has traded at these levels in the past or about $25. \n\nThe last time the 10YR was at these levels was March 10th, February 10th to 15th, January 3rd to 5th and December 23rd. During those time periods SPY traded at close at 385.91, 408.04 to 413.98, 380.82 to 379.38 and 382.91.

You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. \n\nI\u2019ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I\u2019ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   \nBut I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. \n\nThe hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   \n\n\nIt's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   \nIf you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, \"Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel.\" You said, \"fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!\"   \nAnd that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   \nSo is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? \n\nI've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   \n***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  \n\n***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  \n\nLet that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  \n\nI don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. \n\nWhat the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!\n\nMany current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*\n\nThe first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** \n\nWe\u2019re not going into recession, we\u2019re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.\n\nWe\u2019re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world\u2019s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. \n\nTLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpfnurg9e52b1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7aedbcdbd1608718c2feaf1ffdb2210c2235a066",

The upsides with Crypto, Machine Learning, and other processing power heavy technologies just around the corner yet the stock continued to be barely hanging on to life, then  suddenly the stock took off as it began to show the earnings reported weren't temporary but long-term strategic growths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm looking at SPCE with similar vibes, here's why.\n\nJust a few years ago Space Tourism was predicted to be a growing and potential multi-billion dollar per year industry.\n\nHere's some charts because we all like pictures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2i7wr1a1z82b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fcacfa97145c62d2c624c53e1d880b3e02f7f6bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn0d0p42z82b1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=836ae96bef9b557c59ec7d03b51b8fa54f00cec7\n\nBut why SPCE? Why not AMZN or SpaceX?\n\nIt all comes down to: Affordability, Availability, and Astronaut-ability.\n\n# Affordability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Ticket Price: **$450,000** (Target market: Millionaires)\n* Blue Origin Ticket Price: **$1,250,000** (Target market: Multi-millionaires)\n* SpaceX Ticket Price: **$55,000,000** (Target market: Governments & Billionaires)\n\n# Availability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Yearly Capacity: 400 Flights (planned) / 2,400 Persons\n* Blue Origin Yearly Capacity: 52 Flights (estimate) / 312 Persons\n* SpaceX Yearly Capacity: 61 Flights (proven) / 427 Persons\n\n# Astronaut-ability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* Blue Origin flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* SpaceX flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n\nThat's right, they all qualify! The FUD over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line is pure marketing by Blue Origin and SpaceX as well as SPCE bears. The FAA recognizes commercial astronauts (tourists) **who fly to a height of 50 miles or higher.** (see below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjf86qh3z82b1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b72d5c11673ca30c7d8348cb499a19a0ce72b44\n\nLink: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\\_astronaut#:\\~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut#:~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission).\n\nSo in summary it's the millionaire version of the Lady & Lord established title thing, except it's real.\n\nWhy go to school for 6 years and be a Doctor if you could add \"astronaut\" to the end of everything for the same amount of money? If someone is willing to throw out millions on a yacht slightly larger than their peers, why won't they drop the money on a spaceflight?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all brings me back to why the stock is tanking, they just had a successful test flight of their new craft and the stock is down 15% today. Maybe it's \"priced in\" but my guess is that the FUD is getting laid on thick since it is becoming likely that SPCE will be a serious market competitor, potentially taking sales away from Blue Origin or SpaceX, but the reality is that the market is so much larger than current  capacity ([https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel)) and it will take decades to saturate that market. Virgin Galactic is the only relatively affordable spaceflight option right now and if it goes away, space tourism will be a thing only accessible by the ultra-wealthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I like the stock, but I'm probably regarded, so that's why I like it. Or maybe I've had too much caffeine today. This is not financial advice, this is the dumpster behind a wendys.\n\nPS: I wish I could flair this \"shallow dive\" as I'm not that smart on stocks, I still own the stock that must not be named\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.",

They don\u2019t understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt). Their GPU hardware is legit and their most recent data center max is outperforming the Nvidia flagship H100 by 30% across many workloads. \n\n3) Gaming - Gamers hate Nvidia for constantly raising prices while giving shittier performance per $. Intel ARC GPUs will erode market share in a big way over time. I expect the next model, battlemage, to take significant share from Nvidia as the performance per $ will be unbelievable. \n\n4) Foundry services - Intel is the only leading edge chip manufacturer in the West. As tensions continue to heat up over Taiwan, more and more companies will have Intel manufacturing their designs at fabs in the US. Intel will likely surpass Samsung as the #2 fab in the world by 2030.\n\n5) Western Governments - Fabs are the next oil and Intel is the only game in town for the west when it comes to bleeding edge. I expect the majority of the chips act to go to Intel. Same with the European chips bill. These bills won\u2019t be one offs either. Intel has a monopoly on Western leading edge chips and will get all of the government contracts, grants, funding, etc associated with that.\n\n6) Taiwan - If something happens in Taiwan, even a simple blockade, I would expect the majority of fabless producers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, etc) to come running to Intel. If things get heated between the US and China, the US could ensure that all chips for important industries (healthcare, banking, etc) be manufactured in the United States.\n\nThese are just the top six reasons why Intel is generationally cheap. \n\nI would load up on 2025 leaps and keep rolling them back.",

I'm still up a ton from where I started (\\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.\n\nThe worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  \n\nLet's look at the bright side (coping mechanism\ud83d\ude14):\n\n1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)\n2. I already took out and spent \\~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money\n3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.\n4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.\n5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.\n\nLessons/Mistakes:\n\n1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways\ud83d\ude13)\n2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.\n3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.\n4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.\n5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.\n6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.\n7. Next time around, if I do \"short\", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.\n8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.\n9. Probs a million other things\n\nDon't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point. \n\nGL frens WGMI \ud83d\ude0e",

        "selftext": "For those of you hiding in a box, the debt limit is a dumb law that Congress kind of passed accidentally when they consolidated the federal budget into a single thing.\n\nSo now, in our dumb laws, there are two spending limits. The first is the budget of Congress sets, and then there is the maximum amount of debt that the US is allowed to incur. Since Congress has already voted to spend more money than we have, we are running up against the debt limit. This is literally just a thing to authorize us to spend the money that we already agreed to spend. It is very dumb.\n\nOkay, we got out of the way, how do we make money off of this dumb thing?\n\nThe closer we get to failing to raise the debt limit the crazier the stock market gets. High volatility is hard to bet on either way because you have to get the direction right, but volatility itself is pretty easy to bet on. You just buy calls for VIX. It tracks stock market volatility. If you had bought it just as the covid pandemic was starting in December 2019 you would have made an ass load of money. \n\nIdeally, you want these calls dated sometime in mid-june so that you can sell them during the last minute negotiations when the debt limit will almost have been hit but not quite have been hit. The vix almost certainly dropped down much lower once Congress gets back together and raises the debt limit. You might even want to save some of the calls and see if we smash through the debt limit, in which case they will probably become even more valuable. I would guess there's only a 25% chance that we actually default on debt so the safer play is to sell them when they're high.\n\nOther alternatives, especially if you are just hoping to ride the wave of a herd mentality, is to jump into a gold ETF like ishares whatever. This will likely spike at some point, but hasn't moved much yet so who knows? \n\nThose are my two plays, I'm curious what the rest of you are thinking to hedge against this or make money off of it.",

Well, Sifma says the Treasury might have to delay repaying bondholders and screw with their interest payments. And that's gonna piss off a lot of investors.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f You've got money-market funds, banks, and companies all investing in Treasurys to manage their cash. Plus, tons of regular folks have been buying up government debt, especially short-term T-bills. But if a deal isn't reached, those poor suckers might not get their money back for who knows how long!\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sifma expects the Treasury to take it day by day, announcing plans to extend the life of bonds that are supposed to mature on the day before. It's all about keeping the show going, you know?\n\n\ud83d\udca5 But here's the thing, if the Treasury messes up and a bond matures without getting paid, it's gonna cause chaos in the Fedwire system. That could freeze billions of dollars in assets overnight and seriously make people question if the US government has any credibility left.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f This debt-ceiling mess could have all sorts of crazy consequences. It might trigger a full-blown financial crisis and who knows what else. The SEC chair is warning that those hedge fund guys have been borrowing like crazy in the Treasury market, and that's a risk to all of us regular folks.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Remember back in 2011 when S&P downgraded the US credit rating? Well, analysts are worried that more downgrades could happen, and that would seriously shake confidence in the US government. Wall Street would feel the pain, and the government and taxpayers might end up paying more in interest.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The US Treasury's cash on hand isn't looking too great. They've got an account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account, but it's almost $900 billion lighter than last year. Not a good sign.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 This debt-ceiling crap is already messing with the bond market. The Treasury has been issuing fewer short-term Treasury bills, which screwed up trading and caused crazy fluctuations in rates. People are flocking to safe assets like Treasurys, expecting them to rally big time.\n\n Wall Street and the global financial system are on the edge of a freaking cliff.  Ditched my NVDA and AMD holdings on Thursday and made some sweet tendies. It's time to GTFO before this shit show gets real. You better do the same, my fellow degenerates! \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude80",

Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. \n\nThis also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven\u2019t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn\u2019t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don\u2019t without suffering major losses. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68\n\nAs of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today\u2026 we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)\u2026 so this means 1 of 2 things\u2026 first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below\u2026 OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. \n\nNow when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. \n\nFrom a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. \n\nThe ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2ge4o7tq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a311c28180c7002eec379a170a17acc732a95218\n\nPrice action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). \n\nFrom a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  \n Demand- 410.2  \n Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   \n Resistance- 417 -> 418.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dje99ntq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4231c8854754e7512c41c0983c132a2faa5b4657\n\nFrom a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here\u2026 however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. \n\nIf we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wtuyn1uq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf8e4946912109fdc651a74db695e51f5b489a7\n\nOn futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).\n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  \n Demand- 4198 -> 4128  \n Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208\n\n**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3\n\nNow this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY\u2026 here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal\u2026 in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. \n\nThe one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too\u2026 The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. \n\nFrom a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99\n\n**VIX** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7hbrq5vq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3de28101d61d7ad29bd02af4019de508804ae47c\n\nAs I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx3vo5jvq12b1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88585d6e1ee3a7a1bde23f23cecdeff855b7a3fc\n\nHonestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. \n\nI also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn\u2019t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. \n\nTough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, shares his thoughts on the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling debate. His central point is that both increasing and not increasing the debt limit will have disastrous consequences. A smart bipartisan plan that reforms the system and focuses on productivity could prevent a terrible outcome.\n\nLikely Outcome: Dalio predicts that Democrats and Republicans will avoid a long-term default and instead adopt short-term solutions that won't address the core issues. Dalio argues against this approach.\n\nDalio's Background: Dalio's perspective is shaped by his role as a global macro investor, focusing on five major forces: money/credit/economy, politics, geopolitics, natural events, and learning/technology. For him, political polarization is currently the greatest threat to sound decision-making.\n\nThe Political Landscape: According to Dalio, three political \"types\" exist today: the hard-right, the hard-left, and the bipartisan moderate. Dalio identifies as a bipartisan moderate and warns that extreme polarization will intensify conflicts, possibly leading to a non-violent \"civil war\".\n\nRisks of Increasing the Debt Limit: If the debt limit is repeatedly raised without restrictions, Dalio sees a potential for a financial collapse. The endless cycle of spending more than one earns and covering it with debt is unsustainable and could lead to a debt crisis.\n\nRisks of Not Increasing the Debt Limit: On the other hand, failing to raise the debt limit could result in default or cutbacks for those least able to afford them, causing financial and social upheaval.\n\nSolution: Dalio believes that a smart bipartisan plan that comprehensively addresses the U.S.'s financial, economic, and national debt issues is necessary. Swiftly settling the debt issue without addressing the root causes is not a sustainable solution.\n\nThe Battle: Dalio suggests that the fight between moderates willing to compromise and extremists who aren't needs to happen. It's time for moderate leaders from both parties to band together and challenge the extremes in their parties.\n\nReforming Capitalism: Dalio also stresses the importance of reforming capitalism to ensure collective earnings exceed spending. He believes productivity - often neglected - is key to improving incomes without reducing living standards. Both political sides should focus on productivity and fair distribution of benefits.\n\nConcluding Thoughts: Dalio insists his views aren't as important as the creation of a smart bipartisan plan by skilled moderates ready to fight extremists. This represents a chance for courageous moderates to band together and act, despite potential political costs.\n\nRemember, this is a summary of Dalio's article, meant to provide you with a quicker read while retaining the core of his argument. For a full understanding of his views, I encourage you to read the [original piece.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-should-done-debt-ceiling-argument-between-democrats-ray-dalio/?published=t)",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Fellow astronauts, let's take a moment to appreciate the wonder that is Nvidia (NVDA), the powerhouse that's been soaring higher than a SpaceX Starship and shows no signs of slowing down. Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.\n\nNvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (\u00a3760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.\n\nNvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities said Nvidia \"absolutely blew away prior expectations\u201d.\n\nMark Lipacis from Jefferies bank believes that Nvidia\u2019s growing data centre revenues could even surpass the combined sales of central processing units from Intel and AMD, two of the stalwart chipmaker.\n\nBut it's not just about the numbers; it's about the future. Nvidia is at the forefront of AI, the big trend that everyone and their grandmother wants to get into. Companies are scrambling to integrate AI into their businesses, and that's a goldmine for Nvidia. They make the hardware needed to run the complex AI models, and they're ramping up their supply to meet the surging demand.\n\nHowever, with all great opportunities come challenges. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced concerns over trade restrictions that could cause \"enormous damage.\" The geopolitics of the US and China are increasingly affecting chip companies, but Nvidia is still going strong.\n\nIn summary, Nvidia's booming business and its strategic position in the rapidly growing AI market make it a stock worth watching for all of us here at Wallstreetbets. Keep in mind that the rocket ride might have its bumps due to geopolitical factors, but as we know, that's all part of the journey to the moon.\n\nP.S -this isn't financial advice. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nP.P.S. - \"Stonks only go up\" is an investment strategy",

The \"cloud kings\" (if anyone still remembers) experienced significant returns due to the real growth in cloud services and the widespread adoption of cloud technology. AI may very well be the next big thing. However, the risk is real too, as it could follow a similar path to the overheated dot com bubble or the underwhelming performance of the AR/VR Multiverse. Valuation aside, I am inclined to believe AI is here to stay and the potential is huge, as it is being adopted very broadly very quickly across various industries. What do you think?",

        "selftext": "I'm gonna pack this down to a simple concept - \"Money prices.\" I'm gonna skip trying to mansplain what (I think) money prices are, but in a nutshell, think of dark pool trades that occur at a price that differs from where spot is trading (or, where it HAS traded). \n\nFor example, \n\nDate     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/25 | QQQ  | 12:56:00 | 339.98 | 0.24  | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD |  $ PRICE ($340.57) TA > HOD (340.32)\n\nTA = \"Trading above.\" Since this post won't have any charts/pictures to put everything more into perspective,, I recommend pulling up a chart if you wana follow along. If there's one thing I've learned over the past few years, it's that \"money prices\" fill; always. We're 19 (trading) days into May, and so far, there's been 52 TA > HOD (money prices that hit ABOVE spot price HOD) for $QQQ. Although these prices <always> fill, it's not always as easy as today where you can nail a .17% move in 20 minutes. QQQ has always been the golden child of money prices (in terms of time-taken-to-fill). There are absolutely circumstances (if money price > ATH, 52wk low, or shows BIG % move > .35%) where 'filling' a money price, doesn't happen within the hour, day, or week. Another example being today where QQQ hit $338.86 -- from Monday (after having sold off almost -1.75% from that point), or SPY hitting lows -2% since last Friday after seeing $422.69. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/22 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 337.64 | 0.41 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($338.86) TA > HOD (338.67)      \n\nor \n\n05/19 | SPY | 10:29:00 | 420.59 | 0.1 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($422.69) TA > HOD (420.72)   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 golden rules to money prices. 1. They always fill. 2. Even under the most extreme circumstances (esp SPY/QQQ), I've never seen it take longer than 3 months for one to fill. Now, in 2022, things got... I'm not even sure the word. But, now is when I'd really pull up a chart to follow along.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate               Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/24/2022 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 329.60 | 3.22 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($330.85) TA > HOD (330.29)\n\n06/02/2022 | SPY | 11:48:00 | 412.74 | 0.81 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($412.96) TA > HOD (412.86)  \n\n06/02/2022 | SPY | 15:59:00 | 417.39 | 1.95 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($418.35) TA > HOD (417.44)\n\nWhere were we 3 months later, in August of 2022? This was the first time I've ever seen regular TA prices (where, they're NOT above a stock's ATH. Just above HOD/Weekly high) that it's taken this amount of time. Nonetheless, 3 months. If you haven't noticed, this type of arbitrage is typically somewhere around a .15% - .35% move to where spot price is trading. Even a .30% move is on the more-extreme side. But like I said, 2022 got..... idk the word. These next instances are 07/22/2022 - don't mean to spam the length of this, but to clarify the fact that these prices aren't gimmicks, imagine seeing back2back2back2back money prices claiming that next .15% move lower -- \n\n........................................and then nuking it -14%. \n\nDate               Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ |13:27:00 | 301.08 | -1.75 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.55) TB < LOD (301.01) \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 13:33:00 | 300.99 -1.78 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.7) TB < LOD (300.84)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 13:42:00 | 300.75 -1.85 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($297.46) TB < LOD (300.42)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 14:07:00 | 300.67 -1.88 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($300.39) TB < LOD (300.42)  \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 14:45:00 | 300.29 -2.00 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($266.93) TB < LOD (300.11)     \n\n07/22/2022 |QQQ | 15:08:00 | 300.84 -1.82 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($256.69) TB < LOD (300.11) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all..... FOURTEEN f\\*\\*\\* percent???? I've never seen anything like it - not even close. Not even semi-close to a fraction. Nowhere near that. And TWICE? TWO OF THEM? WTF? Again..... if you're a good noodle, and you have a chart open of $QQQ, tell me: where were we within the next 3 months? Over the past 4 years, I can count on 1 hand the # of times I've seen it take > 1 month for something to fill, so 2022 has really made me speculate whether those types of instances could be tied to option expiration? Quarterlies? Just straight up unusual/extreme instances? I wish I knew, but I don't. Regardless, I've been doing this long enough to understand just how near & dear money prices are to the market. Even if time is a negating factor, it doesn't stand in the way for long. That being said, lets get to the kicker.\n\nIn June of 2022, a $340.21 money price hit for $SPY. Nearly -7%. Again, I'm floored seeing one that extreme. F\\*\\*\\* outside THE REALM of extreme. \n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n06/22/2022 | SPY | 09:34:00 | 369.83 | -0.18  | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($369.77) TB < LOD (369.8)\n\n06/22/2022| SPY | 15:03:00 | 365.82 | -1.27 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($340.21) TB < LOD (364.08)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're now, 1 month away to the 1 year mark of seeing that. Not only did SPY (unlike $QQQ) NOT fill that extreme 52wk low, but we're +11% since, and 17% away from $340.21. Maybe, just MAYBE................. maybe, that has to be a gimmick? MAYBE? For the first time EVER? Because if THAT was a gimmick, maybe this one is too? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n12/14/2022 | QQQ | 14:01:00 | 288.79 | 0.25 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($249.77) TB < LOD (287.28) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody calls for a 1987 type crash. Even if they did - they'd be crazy. I'd call them crazy. Am I calling for a 1987 type crash? No. I'm just saying, it's not off the table. It's not off the table at all. As of right now, $SPY has $422.69 to fill, & $QQQ has $341.42. The market will go higher (I'm edumucated guessing + hoping) those get touched so our T's get crossed & our i's dotted. There's no crash flashy enough that isn't warranted for SPY + QQQ to break the lows we made late last year. The closer we get to 06/16/2023, the more I'm anticipating the unthinkable.",

I would be seen and heard if it pleases you. I have advice for all those who would seek to remain regarded. \n\nHere are my qualifications:\n\n- Gambling on Robinhood since Nov 2014. \n- Lost job late 2019 and put all my savings on SPY puts. Held and held, and by Feb 19, 2020, my $35k life savings was $10k. But I still felt like I was \u201cright\u201d and everyone else would realize the markets were overvalued.\n- Pandemic turned that $10k into $160k, but it was never going to be enough. As SPY rocketed from like $218 to $474, lost my ass back down to ~$25k. \n- Gambled since then from time to time, overall down about $10k over the 9 year span, but the ups and downs have been pure trauma. \n\nI now have a baby on the way and I\u2019m done. Seriously. I\u2019ve sent all my savings (still $25k or so) to my wife. \n\nI will tell you something, cuck to cuck. If my wife takes all my money and cashes it out and then fucks my best friend on top of it while showing the camera (held by the boss who fired me, his cock in her mouth) a genetic test saying I\u2019m not the father of my child, and then my best friend and ex boss nemesis both cum huge loads on her wedding ring, and as I get the video of all this sent to my text and open it up, the doorbell rings and my best friend ape-waltzes in like Vince McMahon with my wife on his shoulder, and then she holds her ring hand out and says, \u201click it off you pathetic little gay bear cuck loser,\u201d that is STILL better than giving my actual earned money away to the hedgies and Vanguard. They have enough money.\n\nDon\u2019t gamble. Invest. Or at least have your gambling monitored by someone with a functioning frontal cortex.

That\u2019s a jump from the same period last year, when the beauty retailer reported earnings of $6.30 a share on revenue of $2.35 billion.\n\nShares of Ulta have had a solid run, jumping 37% in the past 12 months and 3% so far this year to trade around $485. The stock\u2019s performance can be attributed to the company\u2019s consistent beat-and-raise quarters, as customers continue to shop for beauty products despite continued uncertainty about the economy\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cStrong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business,\u201d Chief Executive David Kimbell said on the company\u2019s last earnings call in March.\n\nAnd even though several retailers have warned of a slowdown in consumer spending, financial results from the beauty brand E.l.f. could be evidence that Ulta is well-positioned to buck the trend.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) on Wednesday posted [robust earnings and revenue that crushed estimates](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-elf-212503433.html), and provided full-year guidance that far outpaced Wall Street\u2019s expectations. While some retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW) are warning of a buyer slowdown, consumers seem to still want to shop for their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"We think its [Ulta\u2019s] comp growth remained strong driven by solid trends in both transactions and ticket growth,\u201d UBS analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a research note on May 11. \u201cWhile consumers\u2019 interest in makeup products has been picking up, self-care categories continue to perform well too.\u201d\n\nLasser rates the stock as a Buy with a $640 price target.\n\nSales of beauty products have historically performed well during economic downturns. This phenomena is known as the \u201clipstick index,\u201d and refers to the trend where makeup users continue to buy more affordable luxuries, even when their wallets are being pinched.\n\nBut there is room for concern. Inflation is still historically high, and there are clear signs that consumers are feeling the pressure. The University of Michigan recently said that May\u2019s preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to the lowest reading since November 2022.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh cut his price target on Ulta stock to $575 from $600 on May 19, but maintained his Outperform rating.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to prior quarters, we see limited EPS upside potential amidst an aggressive investment agenda, a slightly more promotional beauty backdrop, and a weakening retail discretionary landscape,\u201d he wrote in a research note at the time.\n\nI think the stock will do very well with earnings, so I'm gonna grab a call spread. The stock moves on average about 8% with earnings, so I'll pick something that has a maximum profitability at an 8% gain. This means getting the 5/26 500c ($1210) and selling the 525c ($550). I can grab the spread for $660, with a max profit of 279% if \"all goes well.\" Lol. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction.

It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.\n\nIf you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.\n\nAll y\u2019all with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully you\u2019re still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when you\u2019re selling your calls if you\u2019re not deep ITM when options trading resumes. \n\n\nWhat happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear. \n\n!banbet NVDA $350 in 12h\n\n\nPositions: long NVDS",

However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.\n\nThis led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA, SNOW, CRM)\n\nThis led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "title": "COST Earnings is Today! What are we gonna do?",
        "selftext": "Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results today, May 25. \n\nAnalysts estimate that Costco Wholesale will report earnings of $3.29 per share compared to earnings of $3.04 per share from the same quarter last year. They are also expecting the company to report $54.53 billion, an increase of 3.68% over the prior year quarter. As well as a profit of $14.40 per share this year. A year earlier, the company earned $13.14 per share.\n\nI expect Costco to likely beat the revenue and earnings expectations. It is worth pointing out that despite the pandemic and inflation, the business has managed to grow strongly. Consumers loaded up on essentials in high quantities to keep costs low. However, Costco\u2019s March 2023 sales data pointed to a potential slowdown for the business - with total comparable sales down 1.1% year-over-year (y-o-y), and e-commerce down 12.7% y-o-y. This marks the first time in multiple years that comps declined for the company, largely driven by rampant inflation. However, things improved a little in the April 2023 sales report - which saw its total comparable sales grow only slightly to 1.4%, and e-commerce was down 5.9%. Now that the company\u2019s monthly sales growth looks slow, investors might need to brace for potentially softer quarters ahead. The recent decline might be alarming but Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn\u2019t as important for it as it is for other retailers. The monthly reports do not include any information on Costco\u2019s profitability or segment and membership revenue breakup.\n\n**Revenues expected to be slightly ahead of consensus estimates**\n\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/) estimates COST\u2019s FQ3 2023 revenues to be $55.1 Billion, marginally higher than the consensus estimate mentioned earlier. In Q2, Costco\u2019s membership fee income was 6.2% higher than the prior-year period. And the renewal rate remained strong, at 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Even as degenerate gamblers, we need to keep an eye on this metric when calculating Costco\u2019s long-term growth potential. Also, Costco currently boasts nearly $14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Its long-term debt is only $6.5 billion, so Costco has a net cash position on its balance sheet. For the full-year 2023, we expect [Costco\u2019s Revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/COST/no-login-required/VPSnY8ac/Costco-Revenues-How-Does-COST-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230525) to grow 8% y-o-y to $245 billion.\n\nCostco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COST in this report.\n\n**EPS likely to match consensus estimates**\n\nCOST\u2019s FQ3 2023 earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 per Trefis analysis, almost matching the consensus estimate. In the second quarter, Costco\u2019s earnings per share rose from $2.92 (last year), despite supply chain pressure.\n\nA membership fee increase is unlikely this year because of high inflation, but it will happen sooner rather than later. Costco generally raises its membership fees every five years, last raised in 2017. This should help the company boost its bottom line further.\n\n**A membership fee increase may be coming**\n\nAnother potential catalyst that could increase COST shares is a membership fee increase. In the note, UBS Analyst Michael Lasser said now is the right time to raise fees, despite consumer wallets' being stretched. \"This will be a key focus this quarter. We think there's a good chance that COST will bump its Gold Star Membership fee by $5 and its Executive Membership fee by $10 either this quarter or next.\"\n\nLast quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, which is an 6.2% y-o-y increase as mentioned earlier. Costco last raised membership prices \u2014 a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120 \u2014 in June 2017. The company typically raises prices every 5 years and seven months on average, which suggests the next hike is imminent.\n\n**What to do for earnings?**\n\nDue to high strike prices, calls on this stock is kinda expensive. So I'm going to go for a call spread. The company has moved on average about \u00b14% with earnings, so I'll go for something that it's max profit at a 4% gain. This means buying the 5/26 490c for $510 and selling the 5/26 502.5c for $240. I can get the spread for $270 with a max gain of 4.6x if this goes my way (lol).",

Being a student of history, or at least the history I am aware of, I can point to 4 times the US has defaulted.\n\nNow, before you get your underwear in a bundle, a default is when the issuer doesn't pay the debt/bond holder. I know people like to play fun with words but that's what it is, period.\n\nHere are the Greatest hits of the United States Default tour of 1862 to ????.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 1862 - US sold Demand Notes to fund the Civil War. Government printed paper money ie \"Greenbacks.\" and they devalued vs gold. Default #1.\n2. 1933 - US issued Gold Bonds which could be redeemed for gold coin. Until the Govt decided instead to \"pay back\" the gold bonds in paper currency. Default #2\n3. 1968 - US refused to honor the terms of Silver Certificate Paper dollars which stated that they could be redeemed for actual silver dollars. Adding insult to injury, the Govt voted in 1965 that Silver Dollars no longer had to be Silver. Default #3 and Screwjob #2034\n4. 1971 - Dollars held by foreign governments were supposed to be able to be redeemed for gold, under the Bretton Woods agreement, the agreement that forced the world onto the dollar. Govt said nope, and the world has never been the same. Btw, the dollars for gold was the FOUNDATION of the Bretton Woods agreement.\n\nSo, the US government has defaulted FOUR times.\n\nInterestingly, #2 went to the Supreme Court where the power of the US Government to default was upheld.\n\n\\#4 great quote: Then Treasurt Secty said in response: \"The dollar is our currency but its your (foreign nations) problem.\"\n\nAnd the trend of the US saying F U to other nations, began. Freaking Nixon.\n\nLook, the world and US citizens have already experienced the US govmt sayin nah, we ain't paying. And yet, the US marches on.\n\nAgain, to me one of the greatest risks for the country financially and geopolitically is the overt move by nations to move OFF the dollar. If I was them, I would want to do the same thing. The dollar is the single greatest weapon that the US has.\n\nFinally, I reiterate that all of this drama is BS. Seriously, This would not be the first time the US defaulted. Nor the first time the US was downgraded.\n\nI like my SPY calls, my QQQ calls, and my VIX calls.",

The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**\n\n**If  you haven\u2019t been paying attention, IBM\u2019s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with \u201cdisrupters\u201d like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM\u2019s MAIN FOCUS!**\n\n**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy\u2019s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend\u2019s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**\n\n**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin\u2019s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**\n\n**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**\n\n**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**\n\n**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend\u2019s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**",

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment\u2019s price.\u00a0\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\u00a0\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

        "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/bill-ackman-says-icahn-somewhat-205128986.html\n\nPershing Square founder Bill Ackman has warned that his investment firm\u2019s rival, Icahn Enterprises, could prove to be another Archegos, a hedge fund whose spectacular 2021 implosion caused losses of over $10 billion for Wall Street banks.\n\nIn early May, Hindenburg Research accused the holding company and its famous controlling owner, Carl Icahn, of employing \u201cPonzi-like\u201d economics by paying off existing retail investors with unsustainably large dividends funded by new investors buying its stock exchange-listed depositary units.\n\n\nEver since the allegations were leveled by Hindenburg, which stated from the outset it was selling Icahn Enterprises short in a bet its price would fall, the holding has shed half its market value and is now worth $8.9 billion\u2014less than Ackman\u2019s $10 billion Pershing Square.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pershing Square billionaire said he was \u201cfascinated\u201d by the accusations and in particular the discovery of personal loans taken out by Icahn and secured against the depositary units in his eponymous investment holding, since it could prove highly unstable.\n\nThis, he said, \u201creminds me somewhat of Archegos\u201d, where Wall Street\u2019s prime brokers were left in the dark about just how much money their over-leveraged client was borrowing around town. \n\n\n\u201cIf Icahn were to sell any shares, the stock would likely drop precipitously as the overhang of additional sales and the further resulting loss in confidence would catalyze other shareholders to exit before the deluge,\u201d Ackman wrote.\n\n\n\nBill Hwang\u2019s Archegos family office collapsed like a house of cards two years ago, resulting in numerous banks losing money, most notably Credit Suisse. The Z\u00fcrich lender, caught holding the proverbial bag, suffered a $5.5 billion hit that helped cement its status as Europe\u2019s worst-managed bank and proved a key contributor to its ultimate downfall in March. \n\n\nHwang is now being prosecuted for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which warned that even a single hedge fund like Archegos \u201ccan have far-reaching implications for investors\u201d given enough banks willing to lend it money for speculation.\n\nIcahn Enterprises could not immediately be reached by Fortune for comment.\n\nAckman said he was neither long nor short on Icahn Enterprises, but merely was watching with interest from the sidelines how Icahn\u2019s precariously financed margin loans would play out.\n\n\n\u201cAll it takes is for one lender to break ranks and liquidate shares or attempt to hedge, before the house comes falling down,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe patsy is the last lender to liquidate.\u201d\n\nIcahn blames Federal Reserve\u2019s QE for his failed bets\n\nOn May 10, Icahn Enterprises reported it swung to a quarterly net loss of $270 million from a profit of $323 million a year earlier amid a negative return of 4.1%.\n\nDespite the poor Q1 performance, the sharp drop in the price of its depositary units and, most importantly, Hindenburg\u2019s allegations of impropriety, CEO David Willets ended the investor call after just 12 minutes following his team\u2019s scripted remarks. \u201cApparently there are no questions, we thank you for your time,\u201d he said.\n\n\nHindenburg went on the attack once more the following day after filings revealed that Icahn had now pledged nearly 203 million units against his margin loans, up from 181 million previously, representing a \u201cnear-term critical threat\u201c to unitholders.\n\n\u201cThe deal Icahn is making to retail investors is, essentially, \u2018buy ~$9 worth of value for ~$32 and I\u2019ll give you back $2 of your own money per quarter, for free\u2019,\u201d it wrote, referring to the quarterly dividend payout. The price of Icahn Enterprises\u2019 depositary units have since further declined, closing on Wednesday just below $24 each.\n\nA week later, an analysis by the Financial Times showed Icahn\u2019s investment portfolio had in fact lost money ever year since 2014. In the past six year alone, the newspaper found $6 billion in gains failed to offset $8.8 billion from losses on bearish bets. \n\nSpeaking to the FT, Icahn acknowledged he had made mistakes and failed to heed his own advice and trading strategies that would have limited his losses. \u201cI obviously believed the market was in for great trouble,\u201d he explained, adding he was foiled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing that helped bolster equity prices",

        "selftext": "Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. \n\nLooking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early\u2026 With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high\u2026 However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone\u2026 so as much as they are enticing\u2026 not worth it to me. \n\nNow for those of you that don\u2019t know what the abandoned baby pattern is\u2026 it\u2019s a rarity and doesn\u2019t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up\u2026 May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern. \n\n**NVDA EARNINGS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn6c5tki1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c988280ee606e64ccaea21edca431ebff1ce1ecd\n\nThere is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then \u201cWOW.\u201d I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs\u2026 that truly is mindboggling. \n\nThis market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3\n\nNow from a supply and demand stand point we didn\u2019t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action\u2026 a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. \n\nWe did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. \n\nHonestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. \n\nHowever, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom\u2026. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6yl9mjj1v1b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=853a6d1a3e9b1c57946198621ba7d12481cc656e\n\nOn the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. \n\nWe will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally\u2026 with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 413 -> 418.8  \n Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  \n Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  \n Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8i3gjzj1v1b1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85f45cb78bb1d821682107696293d75addffaa43\n\nFutures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in\u2026 DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. \n\nIf we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). \n\nHowever, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baah8wek1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ad7f1bed271fc0ccc759cf47cd131db00f55f13\n\nSame story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. \n\nIf this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4055 -> 4208  \n Demand- 4128 -> 4075  \n Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   \n Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e0td00l1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb3e112d1b7c7d461bb36df8a515ce6f4ce7c98\n\nQQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY\u2026 QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. \n\nThe daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. \n\nHowever, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk3faoel1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c668e1bcc92d6f4bedd9ecc35986f1df6a5c257\n\nOne reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in\u2026 \n\nIf the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY\u2026\n\nThe next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqfco2tl1v1b1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=210f41cb75f825b2aee9bc8f65387188f8a65045\n\nHonestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point\u2026 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren\u2019t paying out very well\u2026 I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. \n\nStill working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading.",

That\u2019s about 7339 members per gym location. The Planet Fitness gyms near me have a max capacity of 360. How the heck can they get 7400 people in these locations. What am I missing here?\n\nOur Planet Fitness location just got all new MATRIX equipment after a major $1M renovation.  It looks like they are trying to cater to the Black Card memberships by expanding the massage chairs area, and tanning booth area.  No classrooms were added during the build out, empty floor space (floor mat routines) has been taken out.  Chatter amongst members indicate that the screens don't allow them to do their normal workouts, or limit what types of workouts can be done.  The MATRIX tech stated that Planet Fitness bought the lowest level screens available, and quipped, \"what do you expect for $10 month.\"  \n\nWith 18.1 million members at $10/month that's $181million gross per month.  How can a company as large as Planet Fitness not be able to negotiate better screens/software on the bulk purchases?  Are their numbers really not that great as RBC states?\n\nAre the franchisees being forced to upgrade per Franchise agreements and to their detriment, thus artificially increasing Planet Fitness equipment purchase numbers that they tout in their filings.  Is Planet Fitness selling bare bones equipment with high markups?\n\nCongress is considering legislation to make it easier to end gym memberships and force physical/in person renewals instead of automatic renewals. Many gyms require you to cancel membership or face (predatory) automatic renewal. Is this how Planet Fitness has so many members? What will this mean to their bottom line? RBC has upgraded theme, I think they\u2019re overhyped and I don\u2019t see growth or membership numbers that they\u2019re touting if they\u2019re relying on predatory default memberships.\n\nBased on my first-hand experience, I don't trust their numbers.  What the heck am I missing giving a high-end RBC price target of $115?  Should we expect in a year or two from now that they will have to restate their numbers?\n\nFairness FYI - I have memberships in Planet Fitness and One Life Fitness (business travel), and own PLNT in my portfolio.",

The only possible positive I can glean from this scenario is that some of the loans in that portfolio were suffering high unrealized losses from interest rate hikes, but that doesn't seem like the case. One argument I keep seeing for the positive is that \"this helps keep them afloat longer\", but I find that not compelling at all to buy their shares. Now, they were said to have had 15 billion in liquidity (if I am remembering correctly) after the announcement of the \\~10% deposit loss in the first quarter which far exceeded the uninsured deposits. So the rush to sell of assets like this only points to further deposit flight in my opinion. The other scenario is that the 11 bil in short term borrowings has an unsustainable interest cost. A combination of these two problems is probably the most likely. Even if they put all of the proceeds from the sale of the real estate portfolio to their short term obligations, it still leaves a huge chunk of high-rate short term debt that seems untenable given the state of their deposits. So why did the market view this as a good sign? Were they just realizing they have a little more time to squeeze some more money out of the business or has PacWest's position fundamentally changed for the better?",

Started investing 18 months ago with 20k, bought in high lost down to 12k. Started playing options down to 8.5k perfected my strategy now 8k to 40k in 6 weeks. And if I actually followed my own damn advice and stuck to just my strategy I would be at 160k.  You have to be patient. Find what works and stick to it and don\u2019t chase action that doesn\u2019t fit your proven strategy. Mine is simple, doesn\u2019t even involve reading graphs, it hedges risk, and maximizes reward. Don\u2019t pay 2k to some ahole saying he will show you his strategy, if it truly worked they would have money to where your 2k didn\u2019t mean shit. It\u2019s very hard to beat the computers but there is a way. Without going into too much detail my strategy focuses on specific stock price points, terms, and volatility, earnings,that\u2019s it (but it is so specific only one or two positions each week line up). So when the chance lines up I take it. sometimes no trades for a week, maybe 3 trades on a great week. But the key is not to get on a high when one hits and go chasing, like I said if I didn\u2019t do that I would have 4x what I have now. But the key is to find what works, stick to it no matter what, have your stop losses in place (35 percent works for me, less and I miss opportunity, and hedging usually makes that 35 percent up and some). Just don\u2019t gamble, you will lose. But if you ever see me trying to sell you my formula run, if everyone adopted it the market would adjust, I don\u2019t expect it to last forever but hopefully I can adopt with it.
